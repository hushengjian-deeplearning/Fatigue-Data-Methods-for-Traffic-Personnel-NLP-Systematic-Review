Implementation of baby boomer hepatitis C screening and linking to care in gastroenterology practices: a multi-center pilot study,"Background: Estimates suggest that only 20 % of HCV-infected patients have been identified and <10 % treated. However, baby boomers (1945-1965) are identified as having a higher prevalence of HCV which has led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make screening recommendations. The aim of this study was to implement the CDC's screening recommendations in the unique setting of gastroenterology practices in patients previously unscreened for HCV.Methods: After obtaining patient informed consent, demographics, clinical and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) data were collected. A blood sample was screened for HCV antibody (HCV AB) using the OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test. HCV AB-positive patients were tested for presence of HCV RNA and, if HCV RNA positive, patients underwent treatment discussions.Results: We screened 2,000 individuals in 5 gastroenterology centers located close to large metropolitan areas on the East Coast (3 Northeast, 1 Mid-Atlantic and 1 Southeast). Of the screened population, 10 individuals (0.5 %) were HCV AB-positive. HCV RNA testing was performed in 90 % (9/10) of HCV AB-positive individuals. Of those, 44.4 % (4/9) were HCV RNA-positive, and all 4 (100 %) were linked to caregiver. Compared to HCV AB negative subjects, HCV AB-positive individuals tended to be black (20.0 vs. 5.2 %, p = 0.09) and reported significantly higher rates of depression: 60.0 vs. 21.5 %, p = 0.009. These individuals also reported a significantly lower HRQOL citing having more fatigue, poorer concentration, and a decreased level of energy (p < 0.05).Discussion: Although the prevalence of HCV AB-positive was low in previously unscreened subjects screened in the gastroenterology centers, the linkage to care was very high. The sample of patients used in this study may be biased, so further studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of the CDC screening recommendations.Conclusion: Implementation of the Baby Boomer Screening for HCV requires identifying screening environement with high prevalence of HCV+ individuals as well as an efficient process of linking them to care.",0
A multi-facet approach to functional and ergonomic assessment of passive exoskeletons,"Seeing the innovative character of exoskeletal devices, it appears that there is yet progress to be made in adopting exoskeletons to industry, and to the different users' characteristics and needs. Their validation is mainly focused on technological aspects and seldom researchers presented methodological approaches including both physical and cognitive impact on operators, synergically with functional issues. This study proposes a multi-faced approach to investigate the impact of passive exoskeletons on functional and ergonomic aspects providing a preliminary experimental validation with an industrial task. The approach assesses the physical comfort, muscular fatigue, cognitive workload, and users' technological acceptance, to map the overall user experience (UX). Participants were monitored by a mechanomyogram (MMG) and a motion capture (MoCap) system and a UX questionnaire was administered. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of passive exoskeletons regarding the specific task being strictly related to a correct definition of the level of assistance for each user.

Combating Threat-Alert Fatigue with Online Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest,"The threat-alert fatigue problem, which is the inability of security operators to genuinely investigate each alert coming from network-based intrusion detection systems, causes many unexplored alerts and hence a deterioration of the quality of service. Motivated by this pressing need to reduce the number of threat-alerts presented to security operators for manual investigation, we propose a scheme that can triage alerts of significance from massive threat-alert logs. Thanks to the fully unsupervised nature of the adopted isolation forest method, the proposed scheme does not require any prior labeling information and thus is readily adaptable for most enterprise environments. Moreover, by taking advantage of the temporal information in the alerts, it can be used in an online mode that takes in the most recent information from past alerts and predicts the incoming ones. We evaluated the performance of our scheme using a 10-month dataset consisting of more than half a million alerts collected in a real-world enterprise environment and found that it could screen out 87.41% of the alerts without missing any single significant ones. This study demonstrates the efficacy of unsupervised learning in screening minor threat-alerts and is expected to shed light on the threat-alert fatigue problem.",0
"Osteomuscular symptoms on motorcycles in the city of Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil, West Amazon","Musculoskeletal disorders gradually affect workers in different parts of the world, compromising their occupational health and quality of life. Professionals exposed to these symptoms include the motorcycle taxi driver, whose pain is due to the overuse of the musculoskeletal system and little time to recover it. To identify the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in motorcycle taxi drivers in the city of Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil, West Amazon. Cross-sectional study, involving 296 motorcycle taxi drivers in the city of Rio Branco-Acre, Brazil, male, from December 2016 to February 2017. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was used to collect information related to symptoms (pain, discomfort, or numbness) in the last 7 days of work. For the exclusion criteria were, being female; not reside outside the city of Rio Branco, Acre; having less than 3 months of work activity; not be carrying out their work activities at the time of application of the protocol; be limited by clinical or physical issues at the time of application of the protocol. The data obtained in the questionnaire were entered into the Epidata program (Epidata Association, Odense, Denmark) and then transferred to the STATA 10 statistical program (Stata Corp., College Station), for categorization and statistical analysis. The study population is over 36 years old; most reported having a partner and a higher education level. The average daily working hours of the participants were 12 hours, with the majority working over 12 hours daily. Most of the epidemiological variables factors were associated with musculoskeletal pain when the prevalence and prevalence ratio analyzes were performed. Higher prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the lumbar region is with 17.9%. In the lower limbs, the most affected joint was the ankle (5.7%), followed by the hip (5.07%) and knee (5.07%), respectively. Insomnia was present in 55.35% and self-reported headache in 49.4% of participants. The musculoskeletal disorders generated by the daily service of motorcycle taxi drivers are directly affecting the quality of life of these professionals.",0
"Knowledge Gaps, Challenges, and Opportunities in Health and Prevention Research for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders: A Report From the 2021 National Institutes of Health Workshop","Asian Americans (AsA), Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (NHPI) comprise 7.7% of the U.S. population, and AsA have had the fastest growth rate since 2010. Yet the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has invested only 0.17% of its budget on AsA and NHPI research between 1992 and 2018. More than 40 ethnic subgroups are included within AsA and NHPI (with no majority subpopulation), which are highly diverse culturally, demographically, linguistically, and socioeconomically. However, data for these groups are often aggregated, masking critical health disparities and their drivers. To address these issues, in March 2021, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, in partnership with 8 other NIH institutes, convened a multidisciplinary workshop to review current research, knowledge gaps, opportunities, barriers, and approaches for prevention research for AsA and NHPI populations. The workshop covered 5 domains: 1) sociocultural, environmental, psychological health, and lifestyle dimensions; 2) metabolic disorders; 3) cardiovascular and lung diseases; 4) cancer; and 5) cognitive function and healthy aging. Two recurring themes emerged: Very limited data on the epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes for most conditions are available, and most existing data are not disaggregated by subgroup, masking variation in risk factors, disease occurrence, and trajectories. Leveraging the vast phenotypic differences among AsA and NHPI groups was identified as a key opportunity to yield novel clues into etiologic and prognostic factors to inform prevention efforts and intervention strategies. Promising approaches for future research include developing collaborations with community partners, investing in infrastructure support for cohort studies, enhancing existing data sources to enable data disaggregation, and incorporating novel technology for objective measurement. Research on AsA and NHPI subgroups is urgently needed to eliminate disparities and promote health equity in these populations.",0
Choice of Health Options In prevention of Cardiovascular Events for people with Atrial Fibrillation (CHOICE-AF): A pilot study,"Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is associated with high risk of stroke and significant health burden. Recent emerging evidence suggests that modifying risk factor profiles of people with AF may assist to reduce stroke risk and health burden.Aims: The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a brief telephone-based program targeted at improving cardiovascular risk, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with AFMethods: This was a pilot study of a brief three-month telephone-based intervention for patients with diagnosed AF. During an initial face-to-face consultation participants were assisted to set individualized risk factor reduction goals and a treatment plan. Participants received phone-based follow-up for three months, with final assessment at three months.Results: Nineteen participants with AF were recruited, with age range 35-82 years (mean 6513 years) and 53% were male. No changes were observed in either body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference measures. Participation was associated with significant improvement in reported symptom severity (p=0.005). There were non-significant improvements in physical activity, sedentary behavior, HRQoL, anxiety and depression.Conclusions: Participation in the CHOICE-AF pilot study did not improve BMI or waist circumference: however, it was associated with significant improvement in reported symptom severity. Further research is required to determine the most appropriate model of care for addressing risk factor management for people with AF.",0
Employer-mandated obstructive sleep apnea treatment and healthcare cost savings among truckers,"Objective: To evaluate the effect of an employer-mandated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis and treatment program on non-OSA-program trucker medical insurance claim costs.Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis; cohorts constructed by matching (randomly, with replacement) Screen-positive Controls (drivers with insurance screened as likely to have OSA, but not yet diagnosed) with Diagnosed drivers (n = 1,516; cases = 1,224, OSA Negatives = 292), on two factors affecting exposure to medical claims: experience level at hire and weeks of job tenure at the Diagnosed driver's polysomnogram (PSG) date (the matching date). All cases received auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP) treatment and were grouped by objective treatment adherence data: any Positive Adherence (n = 932) versus No Adherence (n = 292). Bootstrap resampling produced a difference-in-differences estimate of aggregate non-OSA-program medical insurance claim cost savings for 100 Diagnosed drivers as compared to 100 Screen-positive Controls before and after the PSG/matching date, over an 18-month period. A two-part multivariate statistical model was used to set exposures and demographics/anthropometrics equal across sub-groups, and to generate a difference-in-differences comparison across periods that identified the effect of OSA treatment on per-member per-month (PMPM) costs of an individual driver, separately from cost differences associated with adherence choice.Results: Eighteen-month non-OSA-program medical claim costs savings from diagnosing (and treating as required) 100 Screen-positive Controls: $153,042 (95% CI: -$5,352, $330,525). Model-estimated effect of treatment on those adhering to APAP: -$441 PMPM (95% CI: -$861, -$21).Conclusions: Results suggest a carrier-based mandatory OSA program generates substantial savings in non-OSA-program medical insurance claim costs.",0

An Anatomically Based Analysis of Objectively Measured Pediatric Snoring: A Pilot Study,"Objective To assess pediatric habitual snoring (PS) using home sleep test (HST) technology and attempt to correlate the objective components of PS to specific upper airway anatomy. In addition, the effects of adenotonsillectomy ( turbinoplasty) on objective measures of PS were evaluated.Study Design Prospective cohort study.Setting Tertiary medical center.Subjects and Methods Pediatric patients with a chief complaint of snoring and probable obstructive sleep apnea underwent an HST (SNAP Diagnostics, Wheeling, Illinois) with a detailed acoustical snoring analysis prior to adenotonsillectomy ( turbinoplasty). During surgery, detailed anatomical measurements were performed and correlated to snoring analysis results. After surgery, patients were offered another HST with snoring analysis. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and statistical correlation with attention to the multiple-comparisons paradox.Results Twenty-two patients (45% male; mean age, 5.4 years [range, 2.4-8.4 years]) completed the preoperative HST and operative measurements. Unlike typical adult snoring, only a minority of PS was from palatal flutter (mean palatal component, 24%; median, 10%). The resistance occurrence percentage (ROP, percentage of breathing events with snoring noise) was associated with body mass index (BMI; Spearman = 0.55; P = .017), subjective turbinate size (0.54; P = .032), palatal obstruction (0.63; P = .008), and mean oxygen saturation (-0.729; P = .0003) but not adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Twelve patients (54%) completed a postoperative HST. The ROP was significantly reduced (median, 20.5% vs 6.5%; P = .006, sign rank test) postoperatively. The magnitude of the ROP reduction was proportional to the volume of the removed tonsils (0.74; P = .022).Conclusion Pediatric snoring has different acoustical characteristics than adult snoring. Objective PS is associated with BMI, turbinate size, and palatal obstruction. Adenotonsillectomy (+/- turbinoplasty) may significantly reduce objective PS.",0
The development of 'Make One Small Change': an e-health intervention for the workplace developed using the Person-Based Approach,"Background The application of digital health interventions is widespread and many employers are implementing employee e-health programs. Intended to enhance productivity by increasing wellbeing, workplace interventions often lack evidence of effectiveness and have low rates of retention. Use of the person-based approach (PBA) is one solution, which offers a systematic framework for developing effective digital health interventions. This paper describes the application of the PBA to the development of 'Make one small change' (Cigna MSC (TM)), an online behaviour change system for lifestyle habits focused on resilience, movement, eating and sleep. Method and results The development of Cigna MSC (TM) took place over four stages with colleagues (n = 79) across Cigna globally. Application of the PBA entailed using high amounts of qualitative data to inform development and a cyclical process of 'listening, applying and delivering' was adhered to throughout. Early stages involved review of current literature and the collection of feedback in relation to existing interventions. Combined, results revealed key intervention development issues that were then used to form guiding principles. Guiding principles ensured intervention objectives translated into relevant design features. The final stages of evaluation included testing images, text and content approaches. Feedback dictated that the intervention should be fun, easy to use and include milestones for self-monitoring. The resulting version was finalised and made ready to pilot so future analysis can be made in relation to real-world engagement and the embedded evaluative content can be used to provide evidence of intervention effectiveness. Conclusions Using the PBA, which was evolved specifically to improve development of digital interventions, resulted in a workplace intervention embedded with in-depth user input combined with evidenced-based theory. This paper illustrates how using a rigorous methodology can drive the creation of an effective digital health intervention that uniquely allows for refinement at each stage.",0
Effect of Positive Airway Pressure Therapy on Drowsy Driving in a Large Clinic-Based Obstructive Sleep Apnea Cohort,"Study Objectives: Drowsy driving related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) represents an important public health problem with limited data on the effect of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. We hypothesize that PAP therapy will reduce self-reported drowsy driving in a large clinic-based OSA cohort.Methods: Drowsy driving (self-reported near-accidents/accidents) incidents from baseline to after PAP therapy (stratified by adherence) were compared in a cohort of 2,059 patients with OSA who initiated PAP therapy from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014. Multivariable logistic regression models evaluated the dependence of change in drowsy driving incidents on other factors, including change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) scores.Results: In the entire cohort (age 56.0 +/- 13.1 years, 45.4% female, 76.0% white, average follow-up 124.4 +/- 67.3 days), drowsy driving incidents reduced from 14.2 to 6.9% after PAP therapy (P < .001). In subgroups, drowsy driving incidents reduced from 14% to 5.3% (P < .001) in patients who self-reported adherence to PAP therapy and 14.1% to 5.3% (P < .001) in patients objectively adherent to PAP therapy. For each one-point improvement in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, the odds of drowsy driving decreased by about 14% (odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.90).Conclusions: In this clinic-based cohort, drowsy driving improved after adherent PAP usage, with greater drowsy driving risk for those with greater sleep propensity. This highlights the importance of and need for routine drowsy driving assessments and careful clinical attention to PAP adherence and sleep propensity in this population. Our findings should be confirmed and may be used to provide support for initiatives to address the public health issue of drowsy driving.",0
Development of an observational checklist for falling risk assessment of high-voltage transmission tower construction workers,"Falls from elevation have been reported to cause the highest number of fatalities in the Taiwan construction industry, accounting for 43.53% of all construction worker fatalities for the period from 2006 to 2015, inclusive. High-voltage transmission tower construction is a high-risk operation due to the construction site locations, extreme climatic factors, elevated working surfaces, and narrow working space. However, the factors contributing to the risk of falls in high-voltage transmission tower construction work have not been characterized. This paper describes the development and application of an observational checklist for assessing exposure to fall risks. Three contributing factors, movement, stability, and fall protection measures, were characterized based on the suggestions of ergonomic experts, interviews of supervisors and workers, and on-site observations. Inter observer reliability test results showed that inter-observer reliability of the observational checklist was acceptable to excellent. A pilot study assessing five primary construction operations suggested that position shifting, wherein workers were found to have frequent exposure to the whole-body movement level and spent the least time in a tied-off full body harness, was the operation with the highest fall risk. These results demonstrated that the observational checklist can be used to identify specific construction operations with fall hazards.",0
Pilot Fatigue Evaluation Based on Eye-Movement Index and Performance Index,"Flight fatigue has always been an important factor affecting flight safety, but how to control and identify the state of fatigue is still an unsolved problem. The aim of this study is to explore the changing rules of eye-movement indicator and performance indicator of pilots under fatigue state by building a fatigue model of task load to excite fatigue, so as to provide reference for fatigue identification and evaluation. Thirty participants attended the experiment, which was required to complete three sets of flight parameters dynamic monitoring and control mission of varying difficulty in a controlled laboratory environment. The eye-movement indicators (blink duration time, average saccade amplitude, average pupil diameter) and performance indicators (accuracy, response time) of 30 subjects were measured in three groups of tasks. The experimental results showed that the blink duration time, average saccade amplitude, average pupil diameter and response time were all significantly affected by fatigue, but the accuracy rate was not significantly affected. According to the analysis of experimental data, it is concluded that the blink duration time increases first and then decreases with the increase of fatigue degree. Saccade amplitude average decreased with the increase of fatigue degree. Pupil diameter size decreases gradually with fatigue degree. These eye-movement indexes show good significance and can be used as good indicators to identify and evaluate fatigue state. Fatigue degree also has a significant effect on the response time. When the task load exceeds a certain degree, the response time will increase exponentially, which seriously affects the operation speed of pilot. The experimental results have important reference significance for the identification and evaluation of pilot fatigue.",1
A pilot randomized controlled trial examining the impact of a sleep intervention targeting home routines on young children's (3-6 years) physical activity,"Background Given evidence suggesting that sleep impacts on metabolic processes, interventions targeting sleep may improve child physical activity (PA).Objectives To describe the potential effect of an intervention to increase sleep on young children's (3-6 years) moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and total PA. To determine adherence to the intervention, impact on sleep duration as well as feasibility, uptake and acceptability was also assessed.Methods Pilot randomized controlled trial with 76 parent-child dyads randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 38) or control group (n = 38). Parents in the intervention group received a 3-month theory-informed intervention consisting of an online video, a telephone call and two text messages. Child PA was assessed using accelerometers at baseline and approximately 3 months. Parents also completed a sleep log and a telephone interview.Results The consent rate was 41% (76/186). Estimated effect size for the intervention relative to control was 10.8 min/day for MVPA, 2.7 min/day for PA and 0.9 h for sleep. Sixteen (44%) parents accessed the video, and 18 (50%) received the telephone call. Over 40% of parents found the video and telephone call useful/very useful.Conclusions This study reports promising effects that an intervention targeting sleep may improve child MVPA and sleep duration. Some modifications to data collection methods and intervention delivery are needed.",0
Evaluating driver drowsiness countermeasures,"Objective: Driver drowsiness contributes to a substantial number of fatal and nonfatal crashes, with recent estimates attributing up to 21% of fatal crashes to drowsiness. This article describes recent NHTSA research on in-vehicle drowsiness countermeasures. Recent advances in technology and state detection algorithms have shown success in detecting drowsiness using a variety of data sources, including camera-based eye tracking, steering wheel position, yaw rate, and vehicle lane position. However, detection is just the first step in reducing drowsy driving crashes. Countermeasures are also needed to provide feedback to the driver, modify driver behavior, and prevent crashes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of in-vehicle drowsiness countermeasures in reducing drowsy lane departures. The tested countermeasures included different warning modalities in either a discrete or staged interface.Methods: Data were collected from 72 young adult drivers (age 21-32) in the high-fidelity full-motion National Advanced Driving Simulator. Drivers completed a 45-min simulated nighttime drive at 2 time points, late night and early morning, where drowsiness was manipulated by continuous hours awake. Forty-eight drivers were exposed to one of 6 countermeasures that varied along 2 dimensions, type and modality. The countermeasures relied on a steering-based drowsiness detection algorithm developed in prior NHTSA research. Twenty-four drivers received no countermeasure and were used as a baseline comparison. System effectiveness was measured by lane departures and standard deviation in lateral position (SDLP).Results: There was a reduction in drowsy lane departure frequency and lane position variability for drivers with countermeasures compared to the baseline no-countermeasure group. Importantly, the data suggest that multistage alerts, which provide an indication of increasing urgency, were more effective in reducing drowsy lane departures than single-stage discrete alerts, particularly during early morning drives when drivers were drowsier.Conclusions: The results indicate that simple in-vehicle countermeasures, such as an auditory-visual coffee cup icon, can reduce the frequency of drowsy lane departures in the context of relatively short drives. An important next step is to evaluate the impact of drowsiness countermeasures in the context of longer, multiple-hour drives. In these cases, it may not be possible to keep drivers awake via feedback warnings and it is important to understand whether countermeasures prompt drivers to stop to rest. The next phase of this research project will examine the role of drowsiness countermeasures over longer drives using a protocol that replicates the motivational conditions of drowsy driving.",1
Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 as a serum neurotrauma biomarker for exposure to occupational low-level blast,"Repeated exposure to low-level blast is a characteristic of a few select occupations and there is concern that such occupational exposures present risk for traumatic brain injury. These occupations include specialized military and law enforcement units that employ controlled detonation of explosive charges for the purpose of tactical entry into secured structures. The concern for negative effects from blast exposure is based on rates of operator self-reported headache, sleep disturbance, working memory impairment, and other concussion-like symptoms. A challenge in research on this topic has been the need for improved assessment tools to empirically evaluate the risk associated with repeated exposure to blast overpressure levels commonly considered to be too low in magnitude to cause acute injury. Evaluation of serum-based neurotrauma biomarkers provides an objective measure that is logistically feasible for use in field training environments. Among candidate biomarkers, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) has some empirical support and was evaluated in this study. We used daily blood draws to examine acute change in UCH-L1 among 108 healthy military personnel who were exposed to repeated low-level blast across a 2-week period. These research volunteers also wore pressure sensors to record blast exposures, wrist actigraphs to monitor sleep patterns, and completed daily behavioral assessments of symptomology, postural stability, and neurocognitive function. UCH-L1 levels were elevated as a function of participating in the 2-week training with explosives, but the correlation of UCH-L1 elevation and blast magnitude was weak and inconsistent. Also, UCH-L1 elevations did not correlate with deficits in behavioral measures. These results provide some support for including UCH-L1 as a measure of central nervous system effects from exposure to low-level blast. However, the weak relation observed suggests that additional indicators of blast effect are needed.",0
Sound in Time: An observational study to identify the sources of sound and their relative contribution to the sound environment of an intensive care unit,"Background: There is a growing body of research that identifies sound levels in an intensive care unit to be higher than current recommendations; although the quality and reproducibility of these studies has been questioned. Noise is generated by the multiplicity of supportive equipment necessary for patient management and by the staff who provide or enable care. Patients remember noise as a prominent and sometimes distressing feature of their intensive care admission. There is currently no study that provides a robust description of the sources of noise in an intensive care unit. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources of sound and their relative contribution to the sound environment of an intensive care unit.Methods: Fifty hours of observational data were collected over a month, using a datasheet designed and piloted for this purpose. Data was collected at four bed spaces, providing equal representation across each bed space, hour of the day and day of the week. A priori, five categories of sound were identified, communication, clinical tasks, housekeeping tasks, alarms and miscellaneous; 55 individual sources of sound were reported under these categories. Concurrently, continuous sound pressure levels were monitored at each bed space.Results: 16,784 episodes of sound were identified during the 50hrs of data collection; the greatest number of episodes were reported in the communication category n = 5699 (34%), with clinical tasks n = 3282 (20%), housekeeping tasks n = 3247 (19%), alarms n = 2939 (18%) and miscellaneous n = 1617 (10%). The highest number of episodes for an individual sound source was nurse/nurse communication n = 1595 (10%), followed by bin lids n = 1004 (6%) and oxygen/nebulisers n = 945 (6%). Of the 55 sources recorded, the top 25 accounted for 86% of the episodes. The average SPL (L-Aeq50hrs) across all bed-spaces during this study was 65.1 dB (SD 3.98) with little variation between day (66.3 dB; SD 3.37) and night time (62.7 dB; SD 3.81), The four bed spaces demonstrated difference in average L-Aeq, with the nosiest being the single room (L(Aeq12hrs)69.1 dB, SD 1.98); and the quietest bed space 5 in an open bay (L(Aeq13hrs)59.8 dB, SD 2.49).Conclusion: Concurrent observational and quantitative data collection enabled detailed analysis of the sound environment. The results provide greater clarity than previous study, into the individual sound sources and their relative contribution to the noise environment of an intensive care unit. This information will help identify which sources of sound are most amenable to modification. There is a need for further study to understand the perception of noise in an intensive care unit, by its main users; the patients, staff and visitors. Current SPL guidance appears unachievable without a change in ambient sound levels. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0
Self-reported reasons for on-duty sleepiness among commercial airline pilots,"Experimental and epidemiological research has shown that human sleepiness is determined especially by the circadian and homeostatic processes. The present field study examined which work-related factors airline pilots perceive as causing on-duty sleepiness during short-haul and long-haul flights. In addition, the association between the perceived reasons for sleepiness and actual sleepiness levels was examined, as well as the association between reporting inadequate sleep causing sleepiness and actual sleep-wake history. The study sample consisted of 29 long-haul (LH) pilots, 28 short-haul (SH) pilots, and 29 mixed fleet pilots (flying both SH and LH flights), each of whom participated in a 2-month field measurement period, yielding a total of 765 SH and 494 LH flight duty periods (FDPs) for analyses (FDP, a period between the start of a duty and the end of the last flight of that duty). The self-reports of sleepiness inducers were collected at the end of each FDP by an electronic select menu. On-duty sleepiness was rated at each flight phase by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The sleep-wake data was collected by a diary and actigraph. The results showed that FDP timing and inadequate sleep were the most frequently reported reasons for on-duty sleepiness out of the seven options provided, regardless of FDP type (SH, LH). Reporting these reasons significantly increased the odds of increased on-duty sleepiness (KSS >= 7), except for reporting inadequate sleep during LH FDPs. Reporting inadequate sleep was also associated with increased odds of a reduced sleep-wake ratio (total sleep time/amount of wakefulness <= 0.33). Both FDP timing and inadequate sleep were most frequently reported during early morning and night FDPs, whereas the other options showed no such phenomenon. The present study suggests that airline pilots' perceptions of work-related factors that make them sleepy at work are in line with the previous experimental and epidemiological studies of sleepiness regulation.",0
Sleep extension is a feasible lifestyle intervention in free-living adults who are habitually short sleepers: a potential strategy for decreasing intake of free sugars? A randomized controlled pilot study,"Background: Evidence suggests that short sleep duration may be a newly identified modifiable risk factor for obesity, yet there is a paucity of studies to investigate this.Objective: We assessed the feasibility of a personalized sleep extension protocol in adults aged 18-64 ywho are habitually short sleepers (5 to< 7 h), with sleep primarily measured by wrist actigraphy. In addition, we collected pilot data to assess the effects of extended sleep on dietary intake and quality measured by 7-d food diaries, resting and total energy expenditure, physical activity, and markers of cardiometabolic health.Design: Forty-two normal-weight healthy participants who were habitually short sleepers completed this free-living, 4-wk, paralleldesign randomized controlled trial. The sleep extension group (n = 21) received a behavioral consultation session targeting sleep hygiene. The control group (n = 21) maintained habitual short sleep.Results: Rates of participation, attrition, and compliance were 100%, 6.5%, and 85.7%, respectively. The sleep extension group significantly increased time in bed [0: 55 hours: minutes (h: mm); 95% CI: 0: 37, 1: 12 h: mm], sleep period (0: 47 h: mm; 95% CI: 0: 29, 1: 05 h: mm), and sleep duration (0: 21 h: mm; 95% CI: 0: 06, 0: 36 h: mm) compared with the control group. Sleep extension led to reduced intake of free sugars (-9.6 g; 95% CI:-16.0,-3.1 g) compared with control (0.7 g; 95% CI:-5.7, 7.2 g) (P = 0.042). A sensitivity analysis in plausible reporters showed that the sleep extension group reduced intakes of fat (percentage), carbohydrates (grams), and free sugars (grams) in comparison to the control group. There were no significant differences between groups in markers of energy balance or cardiometabolic health.Conclusions: We showed the feasibility of extending sleep in adult short sleepers. Sleep extension led to reduced free sugar intakes and may be a viable strategy to facilitate limiting excessive consumption of free sugars in an obesity-promoting environment.",0
Workshop for designing biofeedback of driver's state and emotion in automated vehicles,"Different drivers' states and emotions can affect negatively the driving performance. Recent advances in affective computing now give the opportunity to measure the users' state or emotions using various sources of data such as physiological signals or voice samples. Conveying biofeedback in the car could help to make roads safer and improve users' health and mental state during a ride in an autonomous car. This workshop aims at selecting the drivers' hazardous states and emotions that are crucial to be assessed, as well as how to convey the appropriate biofeedback to the driver, using multimodal interaction in the car.",0
Comparison of concurrent cognitive load measures during n-back tasks,"The cognitive load experienced by humans is an important factor affecting their performance. Cognitive overload or underload may result in suboptimal human performance and may compromise safety in emerging human -inthe -loop systems. In driving, cognitive overload, due to various secondary tasks, such as texting, results in driver distraction. On the other hand, cognitive underload may result in fatigue. In automated manufacturing systems, a distracted operator may be prone to muscle injuries. Similar outcomes are possible in many other fields of human performance such as aviation, healthcare, and learning environments. The challenge with such human -centred applications is that the cognitive load is not directly measurable. Only the change in cognitive load is measured indirectly through various physiological, behavioural, performance -based and subjective means. A method to objectively assess the performance of such diverse measures of cognitive load is lacking in the literature. In this paper, a performance metric for the comparison of different measures to determine the cognitive workload is proposed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using this performance metric, several measures of cognitive load, that fall under the four broad groups were compared on the same scale for their ability to measure changes in cognitive load. Using the proposed metrics, the cognitive load measures were compared based on data collected from 28 participants while they underwent ������-back tasks of varying difficulty. The results show that the proposed performance evaluation method can be useful to individually assess different measures of cognitive load.",0
"Cephalometric, muscular and swallowing changes in patients with OSAS","Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) is believed to be associated with craniofacial and neuromuscular changes, although the interplay among these variables still is poorly recognised. The objective of this study was to identify hyoid, muscular and swallowing changes associated with OSAS, and to correlate these alterations with OSAS severity. Cross-sectional study, in a tertiary referral centre. Seventy-two adult individuals participated in this study: 12 controls (without apnoea) and 60 patients with apnoea (mild, moderate and severe OSAS20 individuals in each group). All participants were initially evaluated by otorhinolaryngologist and neurologist and underwent polysomnography for OSAS stratification. Cephalometric data, clinical myofunctional status and swallow videofluoroscopy exam were assessed. A hybrid effect model was used to analyse swallowing parameters; dependent variables were age, body mass index (BMI) and cephalometric measures. Individuals with OSAS presented lower hyoid position and narrower posterior airway distance when compared to controls. These parameters correlated to OSAS severity. Additionally, OSAS patients exhibited significantly lower myofunctional scores. Both velum and hyoid contraction times were significantly lower in the OSAS group at videofluoroscopy, regardless of its severity. Premature leakage into pharynx was more common in OSAS groups. Laryngeal penetration phenomenon occurred only in two patients (both from OSAS group). Our results suggest that hyoid bone position is associated with OSAS severity. Muscular pattern and swallowing are impaired in OSAS patients, irrespective of OSAS severity and facial profile. These findings indicate a higher predisposition of OSAS patients to present an inferior hyoid positioning, accompanied by myofunctional and swallowing disorders.",0
Long-term effects of storage and thermal cycling on the marginal adaptation of provisional resin crowns: A pilot study,"Statement of problem. Provisional resin crowns may be used for an extended period while complex treatments are completed. The crowns function intraorally; therefore, moisture absorption and thermal cycling may affect the physical properties of acrylic resin, causing a change in marginal gap size.Purpose. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effect of long-term water absorption and thermal cycling on marginal gap size of polymethyl methacrylate copolymer and bis-acrylic composite resin crowns.Material and methods. Specimens (n=10) were fabricated from 2 acrylic resins: a polymethyl methacrylate (Alike) and a bis-acrylic composite resin (Provitec). Specimens were first fabricated on a metal master die. Custom die stems were fabricated for each specimen from a low-fusing alloy (Cerroblend) to eliminate the factor of polymerization shrinkage. Specimens were then fitted to assure a standardized, pre-experimental marginal gap range of <= 25 mu m. Specimens were stored in a humidor at 37 degrees C and 97% relative humidity for 1 year and subsequently thermal cycled (5 degrees C to 60 degrees C, 6-second dwell time, for 8000 cycles). Measurements in micrometers of the marginal gap were recorded using a microscope equipped with a digital video camera and image analysis software before and after treatment. A 2-way analysis of variance with a split design was performed for factors of materials and treatment (alpha=.05).Results. For the factor of material, there was no significant difference; however, there was a significant difference between treatments, with a significantly greater increase in marginal gap size after thermal cycling (P <.002).Conclusion. Provisional crowns made from either a bis-acrylic resin composite or a polymethyl methacrylate copolymer demonstrated loss of marginal adaptation during a simulated long-term period of service.",0
Effect of arm position on spatial distribution of upper trapezius muscle activity during simulated car driving,"The present study aimed to investigate the upper trapezius muscle activity during simulated car driving while adopting three different arm positions. Ten participants were instructed to maintain the following positions: hands on the steering wheel (Hands-On), hands not on the steering wheel (Hands-Off) and hands not on the steering wheel but arms on armrests (Armrests). During the tasks, multi-channel surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from the upper trapezius muscle with 64 two-dimensionally distributed electrodes. Amplitudes of surface EMG in Armrests were lower than in Hands-On (p = 0.004). The spatial distribution of surface EMG changed with time in Hands-Off and Armrests (p < 0.05), but not in Hands-On (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that being freed from steering leads to the recruitment of various muscle fibers/motor units within the upper trapezius muscle and the use of armrests may help reduce the physiological burden loaded on the muscle of drivers.",0
Genetic Dissociation of Daily Sleep and Sleep Following Thermogenetic Sleep Deprivation in Drosophila,"Study Objectives: Sleep rebound-the increase in sleep that follows sleep deprivation-is a hallmark of homeostatic sleep regulation that is conserved across the animal kingdom. However, both the mechanisms that underlie sleep rebound and its relationship to habitual daily sleep remain unclear. To address this, we developed an efficient thermogenetic method of inducing sleep deprivation in Drosophila that produces a substantial rebound, and applied the newly developed method to assess sleep rebound in a screen of 1,741 mutated lines. We used data generated by this screen to identify lines with reduced sleep rebound following thermogenetic sleep deprivation, and to probe the relationship between habitual sleep amount and sleep following thermogenetic sleep deprivation in Drosophila.Methods: To develop a thermogenetic method of sleep deprivation suitable for screening, we thermogenetically stimulated different populations of wake-promoting neurons labeled by Gal4 drivers. Sleep rebound following thermogenetically-induced wakefulness varies across the different sets of wake-promoting neurons that were stimulated, from very little to quite substantial. Thermogenetic activation of neurons marked by the c584-Gal4 driver produces both strong sleep loss and a substantial rebound that is more consistent within genotypes than rebound following mechanical or caffeine-induced sleep deprivation. We therefore used this driver to induce sleep deprivation in a screen of 1,741 mutagenized lines generated by the Drosophila Gene Disruption Project. Flies were subjected to 9 h of sleep deprivation during the dark period and released from sleep deprivation 3 h before lights-on. Recovery was measured over the 15 h following sleep deprivation. Following identification of lines with reduced sleep rebound, we characterized baseline sleep and sleep depth before and after sleep deprivation for these hits.Results: We identified two lines that consistently exhibit a blunted increase in the duration and depth of sleep after thermogenetic sleep deprivation. Neither of the two genotypes has reduced total baseline sleep. Statistical analysis across all screened lines shows that genotype is a strong predictor of recovery sleep, independent from effects of genotype on baseline sleep.Conclusions: Our data show that rebound sleep following thermogenetic sleep deprivation can be genetically separated from sleep at baseline. This suggests that genetically controlled mechanisms of sleep regulation not manifest under undisturbed conditions contribute to sleep rebound following thermogenetic sleep deprivation.",0
Two weeks of ischemic conditioning improves walking speed and reduces neuromuscular fatigability in chronic stroke survivors,"This pilot study examined whether ischemic conditioning (IC), a noninvasive, cost-effective, and easy-to-administer intervention, could improve gait speed and paretic leg muscle function in stroke survivors. We hypothesized that 2 wk of IC training would increase self-selected walking speed, increase paretic muscle strength, and reduce neuromuscular fatigability in chronic stroke survivors. Twenty-two chronic stroke survivors received either IC or IC Sham on their paretic leg every other day for 2 wk (7 total sessions). IC involved 5-min bouts of ischemia, repeated five times, using a cuff inflated to 225 mmHg on the paretic thigh. For IC Sham, the cuff inflation pressure was 10 mmHg. Self-selected walking speed was assessed using the 10-m walk test, and paretic leg knee extensor strength and fatigability were assessed using a Biodex dynamometer. Self-selected walking speed increased in the IC group (0.86 +/- 0.21 m/s pretest vs. 1.04 +/- 0.22 m/s posttest, means +/- SD; P < 0.001) but not in the IC Sham group (0.92 +/- 0.47 m/s pretest vs. 0.96 +/- 0.46 m/s posttest; P = 0.25). Paretic leg maximum voluntary contractions were unchanged in both groups (103 +/- 57 N.m pre-IC vs. 109 +/- 65 N.m post-IC; 103 +/- 59 N.m pre-IC Sham vs. 108 +/- 67 N.m post-IC Sham; P = 0.81); however, participants in the IC group maintained a submaximal isometric contraction longer than participants in the IC Sham group (278 +/- 163 s pre-IC vs. 496 +/- 313 s post-IC, P = 0.004; 397 +/- 203 s pre-IC Sham vs. 355 +/- 195 s post-IC Sham; P = 0.46). The results from this pilot study thus indicate that IC training has the potential to improve walking speed and paretic muscle fatigue resistance poststroke.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This pilot study is the first to demonstrate that ischemic conditioning can improve self-selected walking speed and reduce paretic muscle fatigue in stroke survivors. Ischemic conditioning has been shown to be safe in numerous patient populations, can be accomplished at home or at the bedside in only 45 min, and requires no specialized training. Future larger studies are warranted to determine the efficacy of ischemic conditioning as a neurorehabilitation therapy poststroke.",0
Archetypal physiological responses to prolonged wakefulness,"Acute sleep deprivation is a common workplace and lifestyle hazard known to affect physiological and cognitive performance. Previous research emphasizes the effect that sleep deprivation has on cognitive performance and often correlates changes in physiological parameters to measured performance. One potential problem with this approach is that there is some ambiguity about the true physiological response to sleep deprivation as the cognitive task employed to elicit some performance measurements may introduce confounds. This work aims to supplement previous works by analyzing physiological metrics from the domains of heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, and eye tracking across 25 h of continual wakefulness collected during a baseline measurement period that did not include a concurrent cognitive task to identify metrics sensitive, but not necessarily specific to, time awake. Of the 78 physiological metrics computed, 31 were shown to be significantly affected by time awake according to a Friedman test (alpha = 0.05). The patterns of the 31 significant metrics were input into an unsupervised clustering algorithm, yielding five archetypal patterns of behavior over 25 h of wakefulness. Of the five archetypal patterns observed, two were well explained by the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness model of sleep deprivation and effectiveness.",0
Early Metabolic Benefits of Switching Hydrocortisone to Modified Release Hydrocortisone in Adult Adrenal Insufficiency,"PurposeTo compare metabolic effects of modified release hydrocortisone (MR-HC) with standard hydrocortisone (HC) therapies in adults with Adrenal Insufficiency (AI).MethodsAdult patients (n = 12) with AI, established on HC therapy, were recruited from Endocrinology clinics at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW), UK. Baseline (HC) metabolic assessments included fasting serum HbA1C, lipid and thyroid profiles, accurate measures of body composition (BodPod), and 24-h continuous measures of energy expenditure including Sleeping Metabolic Rate (SMR) using indirect calorimetry within the Human Metabolism Research Unit, UHCW. All participants then switched HC to MR-HC with repeat (MR-HC) metabolic assessments at 3 months. Paired-sample t-tests were used for data comparisons between HC and MR-HC assessments: P-value ResultsFollowing exclusion of 2 participants, analyses were based on 10 participants. Compared with baseline HC data, following 3 months of MR-HC therapy mean fat mass reduced significantly by -3.2 kg (95% CI: -6.0 to -0.4). Mean (SD) baseline HC fat mass vs repeat MR-HC fat mass: 31.9 kg (15.2) vs 28.7 kg (12.8) respectively, P = 0.03. Mean SMR increased significantly by +77 kcal/24 h (95% CI: 10-146). Mean (SD) baseline HC SMR vs repeat MR-HC SMR: 1,517 kcal/24 h (301) vs 1,594 kcal/24 h (344) respectively, P = 0.03. Mean body fat percentage reduced significantly by -3.4% (95% CI: -6.5 to -0.2). Other measures of body composition, energy expenditure, and biochemical analytes were equivalent between HC and MR-HC assessments.ConclusionsIn adults with AI, switching from standard HC to MR-HC associates with early metabolic benefits of reduced fat mass and increased SMR.",0
"The impact of lockdown, fatigue, and social interaction on highway demand during the COVID-19 pandemic: The case of Santiago, Chile","The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the government measures to curb its spread, have significantly affected mobility. Various studies have investigated behavioral changes across different transport modes accounting for sociodemographic variables, yet the focus has predominantly been on public transportation. This article addresses this gap by quantifying the impact of mobility restrictions on an urban highway in Santiago, Chile. To do so, we develop several econometric models based on panel data, which enable us to assess control measures' effects while accounting for their spatial heterogeneity. Our computational experiments demonstrate that traffic reductions were more significant among higher-income drivers (1% reduction per each 100,000 pesos increase). Conversely, municipalities with a higher proportion of elderly residents saw less drastic decreases in traffic. Regarding the effectiveness of control measures, we confirm that the lockdown is affected by fatigue and social interaction. The fatigue implies that users do not fulfill the lockdown as time passes, reducing the effect of quarantines by about 50% during October, 2020. The social interaction effect suggests the lockdown is less effective when not all city's municipalities are restricted to travel, which might be an argument against dynamic or partial lockdowns.",0
International study of 24-h movement behaviors of early years (SUNRISE): a pilot study from Bangladesh.,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) released guidelines for physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep for children under 5 years of age in 2019. In response to these guidelines, this pilot study aimed to (i) determine the proportion of preschool children (ages 3-4 years) who met the WHO guidelines; (ii) examine the feasibility of the proposed protocol for the SUNRISE study; and (iii) assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on movement behaviors of preschool children in Bangladesh.METHODS: Time spent in physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep were objectively measured using two types of accelerometers (ActiGraph wGT3x-BT and ActivPAL4). Screen time and sleep quality were assessed via parent questionnaire. Fine and gross motor skills were measured using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (3rd edition). Three executive functions were assessed using the Early Years Toolbox. Focus groups were conducted with parents and childcare staff to determine the feasibility of the protocol. Follow-up data during COVID-19 pandemic was collected from parents over phone.RESULTS: Data from 63 preschool-aged children and their parents was analyzed in this pilot study. Only three children (4.7%) met all components of the WHO guidelines. Separately, children meeting physical activity, sedentary screen time and sleep guidelines were 71.9%, 17.5%, and 59.7% respectively. The proportion of all children who were developmentally on-track for the gross and fine motor skills was 58.7% and 50.8%, respectively. Parents and educators reported that the protocol was feasible except for the activPAL-4 accelerometer. Approximately, 39% of children (14 out of 37) who wore this device developed itchy skin and rashes resulting in the suspension of using this device mid-way through data collection. During COVID-19, there was a significant decrease in children's total physical activity (- 193 min/day), and time spent outside on weekdays (- 75 min/day) and weekend days (- 131 min/day) and a significant increase in sedentary screen time (+85 min/day).CONCLUSION: Only a low proportion of children met the WHO guidelines. Methods and devices (except ActivPAL4) used in this pilot study proved to be feasible and this has paved the way to conduct the main SUNRISE study in Bangladesh. Future measures should be taken to address the issue of movement behaviors of children during the time of pandemics like COVID-19.",0
A Hybrid Approach Based on Behavioural and Physiological Data for Driver Monitoring Systems,"Driver Monitoring Systems are gaining increasing interest from car-makers, being featured by technologies capable to improve road safety levels and prevent accidents. Currently, these systems are mostly passive, based on distance traveled and travel time. The market trend is moving towards active systems, featured by popular approaches, such as behavioral and physiological. This article proposes a Driver Monitoring System to detect driver's drowsiness with a hybrid technique that uses both approaches. The first performs a driver's face analysis by monitoring ocular variables; the second is based on biometric signals, such as Heart Variability and Galvanic Skin Response. A distributed hardware/software architecture has been designed in order to develop real-time data acquisition and a fuzzy-based inference. Comparison tests between the hybrid approach and the two single ones showed the benefits of the proposed method in estimating driver's drowsiness, considering a subjective estimation conducted during driving sessions with the CARLA simulator.",1
"Impact of a Case-Based Sleep Apnoea Education on the Knowledge, Attitudes and Confidence of Dental Hygiene Students-A Multicentre Intervention Study","ObjectiveThis pilot study aimed to explore knowledge, attitudes and confidence levels of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) before and after case-based education among dental hygiene students. Moreover, to give an international perspective, this study included students from the US and Scandinavia.MethodsA longitudinal multicentre study assessed dental hygiene students' OSA knowledge, attitudes and confidence through a case-based education model. Students from six dental hygiene programmes in the US, Norway and Sweden participated from 2021 to 2022. The intervention group (N = 89) received preview material, live synchronous OSA lecture, case-based screening of fictitious patients and clinical practice using the STOP-Bang screening tool. Controls (N = 70) followed the standard curriculum. The Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Knowledge and Attitudes (OSAKA) questionnaire, comprising 18 knowledge and five attitude/confidence questions, was used. Reliability was assessed and nonparametric tests determined OSAKA knowledge score differences among the baseline, 6 months and 12 months intervals.ResultsThe intervention increased OSA knowledge with the largest increase in proportions of correct responses occurring between the baseline and 6 months and all single items showing a higher proportion of correct answers at 12 months compared to the baseline. Students' attitudes regarding the importance of OSAKA and confidence in managing patients increased from the baseline to both 6 months and 12 months.ConclusionThe case based educational intervention increased OSA knowledge and improved attitudes and confidence among dental hygiene students. The results also determined that the OSAKA questionnaire can be used in a setting with dental hygiene students to provide an overview of their knowledge, attitudes and confidence toward OSA. Current sleep medicine education in dental hygiene programmes is limited, suggesting the need for enhanced and sustained educational interventions to address this knowledge gap.",0
Development of a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) System To Collect Symptom Information from Home Hospice Patients,"Purpose: Previous studies have found that inappropriate assessment of cancer pain can lead to inadequate pain management. To improve assessment, it may be helpful to collect real-time data in a natural environment using computerized ecological momentary assessment (cEMA). Therefore, the aim of the study was to develop a personal digital assistant (PDA) system to collect information on symptoms such as pain and mood states in patients with cancer using cEMA.Methods: Following a pilot study in inpatients with cancer, the second phase of the study involved patients with terminal cancer receiving home hospice care. These patients were asked to record their symptoms in a PDA (a palm-sized portable device) several times per day for a week when they took rescue medications and when an alarm sounded. At the end of the week, an interview on the usability of the device was conducted and overall response rates were calculated.Results: Fifteen patients completed the second phase of the study. Their median age was 64 years and the median survival time after the study period was 22 days. The overall response rates were 90.3% to the sound of the alarm and 80.2% after taking rescue medications. The user-friendliness of the device was rated as 8.8 on a scale of 0 (worst) to 10 (best).Conclusions: The cEMA technique using a PDA might be applicable to patients with cancer in palliative care to evaluate symptoms in a natural setting. This system may also be useful for managing symptoms such as pain and mood states in patients with cancer.",0
Motion artifact detection in respiratory signals based on Teager energy operator and accelerometer signals,"Growing number of applications in which respiratory activity could be measured during natural functioning of patients amplifies the need for replacement of spirometric or pneumotachometric testing with other, indirect methods. One of them, impedance pneumography, thanks to the use of electrodes mounted on the chest, can produce signals distorted by motion artifacts. Since the subject of detection and removal of artifacts from impedance pneumography signals had not been properly studied yet, we proposed a real-time method based on the Kaiser-Teager energy operator and 3-axis accelerometer signals. 24 participants were asked to follow a breathing protocol involving imitating sleep-time changes in body position and sleeping normally. Compared to manual marking, we obtained 81.3% accuracy (80.9% sensitivity and 81.6% specificity) for the optimal combination of coefficients used to estimate the threshold level based on the operator and accelerometer signals.",0
Marijuana use and car crash injury,"Aims To investigate the relationship between marijuana use prior to driving, habitual marijuana use and car crash injuryDesign and setting Population based case-control study in Auckland, New Zealand.Participants Case vehicles were all cars involved in crashes in which at least one occupant was hospitalized or killed anywhere in the Auckland region, and control vehicles were a random sample of cars driving on Auckland roads. The drivers of 571 case and 588 control vehicles completed a structured interview.Measurements Self reported marijuana use in the 3 hours prior to the crash/survey and habitual marijuana use over the previous 12 months were recorded, along with a range of other variables potentially related to crash risk. The main outcome measure was hospitalization or death of a vehicle occupant due to car crash injury.Findings Acute marijuana use was significantly associated with car crash injury, after controlling for the confounders age, gender, ethnicity, education level, passenger carriage, driving exposure and time of day (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-12.9). However, after adjustment for these confounders plus other risky driving at the time of the crash (blood alcohol concentration, seat-belt use, travelling speed and sleepiness score), the effect of acute marijuana intake was no longer significant (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.2-3.3). There was a strong significant association between habitual use and car crash injury after adjustment for all the above confounders plus acute use prior to driving (OR 9.5, 95% CI 2.8-32.3).Conclusions This population-based case-control study indicates that habitual use of marijuana is strongly associated with car crash injury. The nature of the relationship between marijuana use and risk-taking is unclear and needs further research. The prevalence of marijuana use in this driving population was low, and acute use was associated with habitual marijuana use, suggesting that intervention strategies may be more effective if they are targeted towards high use groups.",0
"Efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a novel technology-based intervention to support physical activity in cancer survivors","Physical activity is known to minimize the long-term side effects of cancer treatment. Yet, rates of physical activity participation by cancer survivors are significantly lower compared to the general population. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a technology-based intervention to promote maintenance of physical activity after completing an exercise-based oncology rehabilitation program.The pre-post 4-week intervention included support delivered through tailored text messages, FitbitA (R) self-monitoring, and brief health coaching sessions. The primary outcome measure was accelerometer-assessed physical activity levels. Self-efficacy, self-regulation, social support, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and FitbitA (R) step counts were assessed as secondary outcomes.Twenty-four participants (20 females; mean age = 57.9 years +/- 10.4) completed the intervention. Mean daily step counts and weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity were maintained after the intervention, as compared to baseline levels achieved at the end of 12 weeks of exercise-based oncology rehabilitation. Both self-regulation (goal setting, relapse prevention) and fatigue severity increased significantly post intervention as compared to baseline (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively). Qualitative responses demonstrated overall satisfaction with intervention components.Results demonstrate efficacy of the intervention for maintenance of physical activity levels achieved during exercise-based oncology rehabilitation. Low attrition and high satisfaction provide evidence for both the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention components. Exercise interventions post oncology treatment provide multiple benefits for cancer survivors, yet continued maintenance after program completion is challenging. Technological options offer low-cost, accessible modes to deliver continued monitoring and support beyond traditional facility-based programs.",0
The Annoying Nature of Snoring Sounds Is Not Only about Intensity: A Pilot Study on Exposed Test Subjects,"This study aims to assess (i) which acoustic characteristics of snoring sounds are associated with the annoying nature of snoring sounds; (ii) whether listeners' heart rates correlate with their perceived annoyance; and (iii) whether perceived annoyance is different between listeners with different experiences with their bedpartners' snoring sounds. Six snoring epochs with distinct acoustic characteristics (viz., reference, high pitch, high intensity, short interval, irregular intensity, and irregular intervals) were collected from snoring patients. Twenty physicians and technicians were involved in the healthcare of snoring patients, and were divided into three groups based on personal experience with their bedpartners' snoring sounds (viz., non-snoring, snoring but not annoying, and snoring and annoying). The test subjects listened to each epoch and rated its level of annoyance. Listeners' heart rates were also recorded during the test using a finger plethysmograph. Within the limitations of this study, it was found that, compared with other snoring sounds, snoring sounds with high intensity and irregularity were associated with higher perceived annoyance. However, higher perceived annoyance of snoring sound was not reflected in heart rate-related parameters. In addition, listeners' personal experiences do not seem to affect their perceived annoyance.",0
"Risky driving, mental health, and health-compromising behaviours: risk clustering in late adolescents and adults","Background Health-compromising behaviours in adolescents and adults co-occur. Because motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and disability for these age groups, understanding the association between risky driving and other health-compromising behaviours is critical.Methods We performed a secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial of an intervention for participants who screened positive for risky driving and problem drinking. Using baseline data, we examined relationships among conduct behaviour problems before and after age 15 years, depressive symptoms, sleep, problem drinking, and risky driving (hostile, reckless and drinking and driving) in late adolescents ages 18-24 (n=110) years, and adults ages 25-44 (n=202) years. We developed a measurement model for the entire sample using confirmatory factor analysis, which was then specified as a multigroup structural equation model.Results Late adolescents and adults had some similar associations for pathways through problem drinking to drinking and driving; depression to reckless driving; and conduct behaviour problems after 15 years of age to hostile driving. Late adolescents, however, had more complex relationships: depressive symptoms and conduct behaviour problems before 15 years of age were associated with more risky driving behaviours through multiple pathways, and males reported more risky driving.Conclusions Risky driving is associated with other health-compromising behaviours and mental health factors. It is a multidimensional phenomenon more pronounced in late adolescence than adulthood. In order to promote safe driving, the findings support the need to consider behaviours that are a health threat in the late adolescent population during driving training and licensure.",0
Sleep quality in partners with spouses and children affected by psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: insights and implications from a pilot study,"Background: Sleep disturbances are rather common in psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients; however, it is still unclear if they depend intrinsically on PsO/PsA or the predisposing comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome.Methods: This is a multicenter cross-sectional assessing the sleep quality in partners of PsO/PsA patients. Patients and patients' partners were recruited consecutively. After a dermatological visit to the patient, the partner was interviewed to score his/her quality of sleep with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).Results: A sample of 84 subjects (aged 45.38 +/- 8.55 years, 42 males and 42 females, with an average BMI of 25.24 +/- 1.75 kg/m(2)) were included. Fifty-two (61.9%) of them developed PsO or PsA before starting the relationship. Although the average PSQI was 4.79 +/- 1.47, the prevalence rate of poor sleep raters (PSQI >= 5) was 42 (50.0%). At the multivariate regression, the best independent predictors of sleep quality were having a PsO/PsA child and having a partner affected by PsO since before relationship. More in detail, the former predicted a worse sleep quality [OR 6.98 (95%CI 1.39-35.06)] and the latter a better sleep quality [OR 0.07 (95%CI 0.02-0.23)]. Specifically, performing a subgroup analysis among those who had a child and stratifying according to the presence of an affected child, no differences could be found for each parameter under study, except for PSQI, which was significantly higher in spouses with affected children (6.68 +/- 1.11 versus 4.35 +/- 1.11, p<0.001).Conclusions: The present study showed that having a child significantly negatively impacted on sleep quality of the parent, whereas having a partner being affected by PsO since before the beginning of the relationship protected against poor sleep quality. Having a child affected by PsO was, instead, a risk factor.",0
"Lack of changes in serum prolactin, FSH, TSH, and estradiol after melatonin treatment in doses that improve sleep and reduce benzodiazepine consumption in sleep-disturbed, middle-aged, and elderly patients","An open pilot study on the safety and efficacy of melatonin in the treatment of insomniac patients was conducted in 22 subjects (16 females), mean +/- S.D. age 60.1 +/- 9.5 years. All patients received 3 mg of gelatin melatonin capsules per os daily for 6 months, 30 min before expected sleep time. Twenty of 22 patients were on benzodiazepine treatment and they continued this treatment for part of or for the entire melatonin administration period. Serum concentrations of prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), or estradiol were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in morning samples at the beginning and after 6 months of melatonin administration, and standard clinical laboratory tests for blood components were performed. Urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) excretion was measured by RIA before treatment. Serum concentrations of prolactin, FSH, TSH, or estradiol did not exhibit changes after 6 months of melatonin administration, nor were any indications of hematologic or blood biochemistry alteration found. Melatonin augmented significantly the quality and duration of sleep, and decreased sleep latency and the number of awakening episodes, as assessed from sleep logs filled by the patients (first 21 days) and from structured interviews performed by incumbent physicians (up to 6 months). Estimates of next-day function (i.e., alertness in the morning and during the day) also improved significantly during melatonin treatment. The observed effect lasted for the entire period examined (up to 6 months), with 22 out of 22 patients showing improved sleep at the end of treatment. The urinary excretion of aMT6s before starting administration of melatonin correlated negatively and significantly with age, but not with the intensity of sleep the disorder or the outcome of treatment. In 13 of 20 patients taking benzodiazepines together with melatonin, benzodiazepine use could be stopped, and in another four patients, benzodiazepine dose could be decreased to 25-66% of the initial dose. The results of this open, subacute administration trial indicate that melatonin is a safe and useful treatment for sleep disturbances in middle-aged or elderly patients, either by itself or together with benzodiazepines.",0
Multi-Index Measurement of Fatigue Degree Under the Simulated Monitoring Task of a Nuclear Power Plant,"The fatigue state of nuclear power operators is of vital importance to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant. With the development of the digital manipulation interface in recent years, the fatigue type and degree of operators have undergone changes. The interface of the nuclear power monitoring task is simulated in this experiment, and multiple fatigue detection modes are used to measure the fatigue state of operators. Results show that the subjective fatigue reporting method and PERCLOS P80 can reflect the change of fatigue state. The correlation between task performance and fatigue is not remarkable, and the sensitivity of the electrocardiographic heart rate variability indicator is poor. The accuracy also remains to be further verified.",1
Effect of sleep deprivation and driving duration on the useful visual field in younger and older subjects during simulator driving,"Nine older subjects (40-51 years) and 10 younger subjects (18-30 years) took part in two one-hour driving sessions. They performed a very monotonous task during which they had to follow a vehicle either after a complete night of sleep or after one night of sleep deprivation. While driving their useful visual field was assessed by introducing signals that would appear on the whole road scene.The analysis of the data indicates that the ability to process peripheral signals deteriorates with age, driving duration and sleep deprivation. However, the effects of these three variables on the peripheral visual ability are not similar in a dual task. The driver's useful visual field changes with age and prolongation of the monotonous driving activity according to a tunnel vision phenomenon. On the other hand, a sleep debt deteriorates the useful visual field according to a general interference phenomenon. These results are discussed in terms of decrease in the level of arousal and increase of fatigue. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Reduces Plasma Neurochemical Levels in Patients with OSA: A Pilot Study,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. This study determined whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which can alleviate OSA symptoms, can reduce neurochemical biomarker levels. Thirty patients with OSA and normal cognitive function were recruited and divided into the control (n = 10) and CPAP (n = 20) groups. Next, we examined their in-lab sleep data (polysomnography and CPAP titration), sleep-related questionnaire outcomes, and neurochemical biomarker levels at baseline and the 3-month follow-up. The paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to examine changes. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to increase the robustness of outcomes. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were significantly decreased in the CPAP group. The mean levels of total tau (T-Tau), amyloid-beta-42 (A beta(42)), and the product of the two (A beta(42) x T-Tau) increased considerably in the control group (Delta T-Tau: 2.31 pg/mL; Delta A beta(42): 0.58 pg/mL; Delta A beta(42) x T-Tau: 48.73 pg(2)/mL(2)), whereas the mean levels of T-Tau and the product of T-Tau and A beta(42) decreased considerably in the CPAP group (Delta T-Tau: -2.22 pg/mL; Delta A beta(42) x T-Tau: -44.35 pg(2)/mL(2)). The results of ANCOVA with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, baseline measurements, and apnea-hypopnea index demonstrated significant differences in neurochemical biomarker levels between the CPAP and control groups. The findings indicate that CPAP may reduce neurochemical biomarker levels by alleviating OSA symptoms.",0
Eye locating arithmetic in fatigue detection based on image processing,"The fatigue level of military pilot directly affects the flight safety. The fatigue level of system operator directly affects the operational electiveness. Developing high-performance personnel fatigue real-time monitoring and alerting technology on board is significant. Based on eye states detection, we judge the fatigue state of military pilot. Though the location speed of maximum variance between two classes is faster and the location speed of gray-level integration projection is faster, it is difficult to directly find the feature points. To solve this problem, we introduce the way of eye location and detection. It is based on Gabor transforms projected subspace and multi-state template. The horizontal direction gray scale of the eye changes frequently, sharply. Compared with the eyebrow and nose, the change of eye gray scale is more frequently. After eye location, we take PERCLOS as the method to judge the state of the military pilot and we statistic the percentage of the number of eyes closed picture, f. If f is larger than 0.4, we think the military pilot is fatigue. If f is larger than 0.1 but less than 0.4, we think the military pilot is out of mind. If f is less than 0.1, we think the military pilot is full of energy.",1
Effect of a multicomponent exercise intervention on brain metabolism: A randomized controlled trial on Alzheimer's pathology (Dementia-MOVE).,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity has shown a positive impact on aging and neurodegeneration and represents a possible treatment option in cognitive decline. However, its underlying mechanisms and influences on brain pathology remain unclear. Dementia-MOVE (Multi-Objective Validation of Exercise) is a randomized-controlled pilot trial, including 50 patients with amnestic cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's pathology, aiming to analyze the effect of physical activity and fitness on disease progression.METHODS: Dementia-MOVE is divided into two arms, of either an intervention comprising physical activity, for at least twice a week, combined with a psychoeducational program, or a sole psychoeducational program. Physical activity intervention includes a supervised and unsupervised multimodal concept combining resistance, endurance, coordinative, and aerobic training. The primary outcome is the change of brain metabolism due to physical interventional treatment. Besides metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including sodium and phosphorus imaging, resting state functional MRI, T1-, T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), as well as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the brain and whole-body fat MRI are performed before and after intervention, and will be compared in their sensitivity for the detection of intervention effects. We further assess cognitive performance, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, fitness, and sleep via questionnaires/interviews and/or fitness trackers, as well as microbiome, under the aspect of Alzheimer's pathology.DISCUSSION: The aim of Dementia-MOVE is to investigate the effect of a multimodal exercise program on Alzheimer's pathology under different aspects of the disease. In this context, one of the main aims is the comparison of different MRI methods regarding their responsiveness for the detection of alterations induced by physical activity. As an underlying goal, new treatment and diagnostic options, as well as the exploration of fitness effects on brain structure and metabolism within a whole-body perspective of Alzheimer's disease are envisaged.",0
"MDMA (ecstasy) effects on actual driving performance before and after sleep deprivation, as function of dose and concentration in blood and oral fluid","Experimental research has shown that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) can improve some psychomotor driving skills when administered during the day. In real life, however, MDMA is taken during the night, and driving may likely occur early in the morning after a night of raving and sleep loss.The present study assessed the effects of MDMA on road-tracking and car-following performance in on-the-road driving tests in normal traffic.Sixteen recreational MDMA users participated in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled four-way cross-over design. They received single, evening doses of 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg MDMA on separate occasions. Actual driving tests were conducted in the evening when MDMA serum concentrations were maximal and in the morning after a night of sleep loss.The primary measure of driving, i.e., standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP, a measure of weaving) was significantly increased during driving tests in the morning in all treatment conditions, irrespective of MDMA dose and concentration. The increments in SDLP were of high clinical relevance and comparable to those observed for alcohol at blood alcohol concentrations > 0.8 mg/mL. These impairments were primarily caused by sleep loss.In general, MDMA did not affect driving performance nor did it change the impairing effects of sleep loss. It is concluded that MDMA cannot compensate for the impairing effects of sleep loss and that drivers who are under the influence of MDMA and sleep deprived are unfit to drive.",0
A Pilot Study of Shoulder Placement for Actigraphy in Children,"Children with neurodevelopmental disorders may have difficulty tolerating devices that monitor sleep, presenting challenges in measuring sleep disturbances in this population. Although wrist actigraphy has advantages over polysomnography, some children remain unable to tolerate wrist placement. This study piloted an alternative site for actigraphy in 8 children with autism, ages 6-10 years. Results are presented from the 2 locations (custom pocket shoulder location and wrist location) using Bland-Altman limits of agreement and other statistical measures to compare sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset. The use of an alternative actigraphy site for children with autism, who have difficulty tolerating actigraphy placement, appears promising and worthy of further study.",0
Driving posture recognition by convolutional neural networks,"Driver fatigue and inattention have long been recognised as the main contributing factors in traffic accidents. This study presents a novel system which applies convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically learn and predict pre-defined driving postures. The main idea is to monitor driver hand position with discriminative information extracted to predict safe/unsafe driving posture. In comparison to previous approaches, CNNs can automatically learn discriminative features directly from raw images. In the authors' works, a CNNmodel was first pre-trained by an unsupervised feature learning method called sparse filtering, and subsequently fine-tuned with classification. The approach was verified using the Southeast University driving posture dataset, which comprised of video clips covering four driving postures, including normal driving, responding to a cell phone call, eating, and smoking. Compared with other popular approaches with different image descriptors and classification methods, the authors' scheme achieves the best performance with an overall accuracy of 99.78%. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalisation performance in more realistic conditions, the method was further tested using other two specially designed datasets which takes into account of the poor illuminations and different road conditions, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.3 and 95.77%, respectively.",0
"Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Blood Glucose, Food Cravings, and Affect in a Non-Diabetic: An N-of-1 Randomized Pilot Study","Sleep deprivation is a prevalent and rising health concern, one with known effects on blood glucose (BG) levels, mood, and calorie consumption. However, the mechanisms by which sleep deprivation affects calorie consumption (e.g., measured via self-reported types of craved food) are unclear, and may be highly idiographic (i.e., individual-specific). Single-case or n-of-1 randomized trials (N1RT) are useful in exploring such effects by exposing each subject to both sleep deprivation and baseline conditions, thereby characterizing effects specific to that individual. We had two objectives: (1) To test and generate individual-specific N1RT hypotheses of the effects of sleep deprivation on next-day BG level, mood, and food cravings in two non-diabetic individuals; (2) To refine and guide a future n-of-1 study design for testing and generating such idiographic hypotheses for personalized management of sleep behavior in particular, and for chronic health conditions more broadly. We initially did not find evidence for idiographic effects of sleep deprivation, but better-refined post hoc findings indicate that sleep deprivation may have increased BG fluctuations, cravings, and negative emotions. We also introduce an application of mixed-effects models and pancit plots to assess idiographic effects over time.",0
Differentiated resistance training of the paravertebral muscles in patients with unstable spinal bone metastasis under concomitant radiotherapy: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial,"Background: Metastatic bone disease is a common and severe complication in patients with advanced cancer. Radiotherapy (RT) has long been established as an effective local treatment for metastatic bone disorder. This study assesses the effects of RT combined with muscle-training exercises in patients with unstable bone metastases of the spinal column from solid tumors. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of muscle-training exercises concomitant to RT. Secondly, quality of life, fatigue, overall and bone survival, and local control will be assessed.Methods/Design: This study is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, explorative intervention study with a parallel-group design to determine multidimensional effects of a course of exercises concomitant to RT on patients who have unstable metastases of the vertebral column, first under therapeutic instruction and subsequently performed by the patients themselves independently for strengthening the paravertebral muscles. On the days of radiation treatment the patients will be given four different types of exercises to ensure even isometric muscle training of all the spinal muscles. In the control group progressive muscle relaxation will be carried out parallel to RT. The patients will be randomized into two groups: differentiated muscle training or progressive muscle relaxation with 30 patients in each group.Discussion: Despite the clinical experience that RT is an effective treatment for bone metastases, there is insufficient evidence for a positive effect of the combination with muscle-training exercises in patients with unstable bone metastases. Our previous DISPO-1 trial showed that adding muscle-training exercises to RT is feasible, whereas this was not proven in patients with an unstable spinal column. Although associated with several methodological and practical challenges, this randomized controlled trial is needed.",0
Research on eye location algorithm robust to driver's pose and illumination,"Driver's drowsiness is one of the major causes of road accidents. The monitoring of a given driver's eye state by the use of a camera is considered to be a promising way to detect driver's drowsiness due to its accuracy and non-intrusiveness. However, eye location remains a challenging vision problem because of the constantly changing of illumination and driver's pose. Active shape model (ASM) is introduced in this paper to align the face. Though the ASM is a powerful statistical tool, it can suffer from changes in illumination and posture. Three contributions are involved in this paper. First, in order to maximize the tolerance of the ASM algorithm to illumination changes, we propose a robust ASM method with a novel local texture model learned from the self-quotient image instead of the original image. Second, a double layer overall shape model is proposed to enhance the adaptability of ASM. Third, strong constraints are achieved by an on-line learning of the distribution characteristics of the model parameters. The results show that the proposed algorithm is robust to the variation of illumination and driver's pose.",1
Frequency of Past and Current Psychiatric Disorders in Patients Referred for Polysomnography: A Pilot Study,"Study Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of past and current psychiatric disorders among patients referred to a sleep unit for polysomnography.Methods: A total of 152 patients referred to the Sleep Center of Timone Hospital in Marseille were included from January 12 to March 31, 2015. Clinical data were collected using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.Results: The final sample consisted of 102 patients. Polysomnography helped diagnose the following common sleep disorders: obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, and non-rapid eye movement sleep arousal disorder. Ninety patients (88%) had psychiatric disorders. All patients (27) without a common sleep disorder diagnosis had psychiatric disorders and among patients with a common sleep disorder diagnosis 84% had psychiatric disorders. Among the psychiatric disorders a past major depressive episode was the most frequent pathology.Conclusions: This study shows that patients referred to a sleep unit have a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders. This may be explained by residual symptoms of psychiatric illnesses, a diagnostic misdirection, a denial of psychiatric diagnosis, or an undiagnosed somatic symptom disorder. Finally, this study shows the importance of cross-disciplinary communication considering the diagnostic heterogeneity that may represent a sleep complaint.",0
Driver Fatigue Detection Systems: A Review,"Driver fatigue has been attributed to traffic accidents; therefore, fatigue-related traffic accidents have a higher fatality rate and cause more damage to the surroundings compared with accidents where the drivers are alert. Recently, many automobile companies have installed driver assistance technologies in vehicles for driver assistance. Third party companies are also manufacturing fatigue detection devices; however, much research is still required for improvement. In the field of driver fatigue detection, continuous research is being performed and several articles propose promising results in constrained environments, still much progress is required. This paper presents state-of-the-art review of recent advancement in the field of driver fatigue detection. Methods are categorized into five groups, i.e., subjective reporting, driver biological features, driver physical features, vehicular features while driving, and hybrid features depending on the features used for driver fatigue detection. Various approaches have been compared for fatigue detection, and areas open for improvements are deduced.",1
ADVANCED MODELS FOR FATIGUE LIFE ESTIMATION OF COMBUSTOR COMPONENTS FOR GAS TURBINE APPLICATION,"Modern day combustors operate at very high temperatures which are close to combustor material softening temperatures. At the same time, to meet stringent emission legislations there is a strong drive to improve upon the rich burn combustor technology or shift to advanced lean burn combustor technologies. One of the key driver to improve emission is to save the cooling air budget and use the saved air for primary combustion but this approach would require more advanced and efficient cooling techniques. Fan shaped effusion cooling technology is a very promising technique as it offers high film cooling effectiveness. However, complex cooling features associated with this technology can lead to higher stress concertation and localized triaxial stress state. This stress strain field in combination with a typical gas turbine engine operating cycle makes such effusion holes highly vulnerable to the thermo-mechanical fatigue failure. Hence to ensure the safety and reliability of combustor liners with such innovative features, it is essential to have thorough understanding of the stress-strain field in the vicinity and accurate prediction of life to first crack. The biggest challenge the designers and engineers face while predicting the initiation life of a structure is selecting the appropriate fatigue damage model for an application. This is due to following reasons: (a) The scatter in fatigue life predicted using different models and experimental values are very huge (b) There is no general universal method which can predict the multiaxial fatigue life accurately for all the materials and loading conditions (c) No general consensus exits among the researchers on which model have to be used for a particular application, material, loading and geometry (d) Application level studies are seldom available on this subject, most of the studies are restricted to laboratory level specimens with very limited implications to industry. Ideally, the fatigue damage model which has to be used for a particular application has to be validated through experiments. To meet this objective, several test specimens featuring novel fan shaped hole geometries were mass-produced using state of the art laser drilling technology. All these specimens were subjected to strain controlled isothermal low cycle fatigue test and the cycles to crack initiation was monitored using potential drop method. Six different multiaxial fatigue damage models (which can be used in low cycle fatigue regime) viz. Walker model, Smith Watson and Topper model (SWT), Fatemi Socie model (FS), Wang and Brown model (WB), Shang model (SW) and Xu model were selected and the life estimated by these models were compared with the experimental values. From the study it is observed that Xu model in which the damage parameter is built using the concept of shear strain energy looks most promising for this application.",0
Assessing palliative care need in left ventricular assist device patients and heart transplant recipients,"Objectives: Palliative care (PC) has gained rising attention in a holistic treatment approach to chronic heart failure (HF). It is unclear whether there is a need for PC in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients or heart transplant recipients.Methods: In a cross-sectional explorative pilot study, outpatients after heart transplantation (HTx, n = 69) or LVAD implantation (n = 21) underwent screening for palliative care (PC) need and evaluation of symptom burden and psychological distress using tools that emanated from palliative cancer care.Results: The `Palliative Care Screening Tool for Heart Failure Patients' revealed scores of 4.3 +/- 2.2 in HTx and 6.0 +/- 2.1 in LVAD patients (max. 12 points, P = 0.003), indicating the need for PC (>5 points) in 32% of HTx and 67% of LVAD patients. Symptom burden, as assessed by MIDOS ('Minimal Documentation System for Palliative Care') scores was substantial in both groups (4.9 +/- 4.7 in HTx vs 6.6 +/- 5.3 in LVAD, max. 30 points, P = 0.181). 'Fatigue', 'weakness' and 'pain' were the most frequent symptoms. Using the 'Distress-Thermometer', 'clinically relevant' distress was detected in 57% of HTx and 47% of LVAD patients (P = 0.445). In the PHQ-4 ('4-Item Patient Health Questionnaire'), 45% of LVAD patients, compared to only 10% of HTx patients, reported mild symptoms of anxiety and depression.Conclusions: Findings reveal substantial need for PC in LVAD patients and, to a lesser extent, in heart transplant recipients, suggesting that multi-disciplinary PC should be introduced into routine aftercare.",0
A pilot study to assess the effects of preventing fluid retention in the legs by wearing compression stockings on overnight airway narrowing in mild asthma,"PurposeNocturnal asthma is a sign of asthma worsening and could be partially due to more fluid drawn into the thorax during sleep by gravitational force and/or pharyngeal collapse in those with obstructive sleep apnea. Wearing compression stockings during the day reduces fluid shift from the legs to the neck overnight. However, the potential effect of wearing compression stockings to reduce fluid accumulation in the leg and to improve nocturnal small airway narrowing in patients with asthma has not been investigated. This study investigates whether reducing leg fluid volume by wearing compression stockings during the day would attenuate small airway narrowing in patients with asthma before and after sleep.MethodsWe enrolled 11 participants with asthma. All participants underwent overnight polysomnography with or without wearing compression stockings for 2 weeks. Before and after sleep, leg fluid volume (LFV) was measured by bioelectrical impedance, and airway narrowing was primarily assessed by respiratory system resistance and reactance at 5 Hz (R5 and X5 respectively) using oscillometry.ResultsAfter 2 weeks of wearing compression stockings, the LFV measured in the evening was reduced ( increment = - 192.6 +/- 248.3 ml, p = 0.02), and R5 and X5 improved ( increment = - 0.7 +/- 0.9 cmH2O/L/s, p = 0.03 and 0.2 +/- 1.4 cmH2O/L/s, p = 0.05 respectively). No changes were observed in the morning.ConclusionsPreventing fluid retention in the legs by wearing compression stockings for 2 weeks during the day, reduced LFV and airway narrowing in the evening in all participants with asthma, but not in the morning after sleep.",0
Development and Evaluation of a Modified Hospital Elder Life Program,"Background: Older hospitalized patients often experience geriatric syndromes that may be prevented using complex interventions. For example, the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) was shown to be successful, but sites with limited resources might find HELP costly. Thus, modifying HELP to include only key components might prove more cost-effective.Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a modified HELP intervention derived from a conceptual model of shared geriatric risk factors for older hospitalized patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.Method: The modified HELP intervention was developed and evaluated in Taiwan, based on the UK Medical Research Council evaluation framework. According to this 4-phase framework, HELP (Phase 1) was modified based on a theoretical model of shared risk factors, and HELP's feasibility and efficacy (Phases 2 and 3) were evaluated between August 2007 and April 2009 in a preintervention and post-intervention pilot trial. Participants were 179 patients enrolled as the control (n = 77) and intervention (n = 102) groups.Results: The modified HELP intervention targeting 3 shared risk factors (cognitive, functional, and nutritional status) was developed and implemented successfully on a surgical ward. By hospital discharge, patients in the intervention group experienced significantly less risk for five geriatric syndromes: functional dependence, malnutrition, in-hospital weight loss 95%, depression, and sleep disturbance (adjusted odds ratio = 0.01-0.39; p<.05). These results were independent of patients' baseline malnutrition, education, periampullary diagnosis, and duration of surgery.Conclusions: The positive findings of this pilot trial support continued development of modified HELP. The next logical step in testing its effectiveness and long-term benefit is a randomized controlled trial.",0
Pilot Controlled Trial of Mindfulness Meditation and Education for Dementia Caregivers,"Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate whether a mindfulness meditation intervention may be effective in caregivers of close relatives with dementia and to help refine the protocol for future larger trials.Design: The design was a pilot randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness meditation intervention adapted from the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy program in relation to two comparison groups: an education class based on Powerful Tools for Caregivers serving as an active control group and a respite-only group serving as a pragmatic control.Settings/location: This study was conducted at the Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.Subjects: The subjects were community-dwelling caregivers aged 45-85 years of close relatives with dementia.Interventions: The two active interventions lasted 7 weeks, and consisted of one 90-minute session per week along with at-home implementation of knowledge learned. The respite-only condition provided the same duration of respite care that was needed for the active interventions.Outcome measures: Subjects were assessed prior to randomization and again after completing classes at 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was a self-rated measure of caregiver stress, the Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC). Secondary outcome measures included mood, fatigue, self-efficacy, mindfulness, salivary cortisols, cytokines, and cognitive function. We also evaluated self-rated stress in the subjects' own environment, expectancy of improvement, and credibility of the interventions.Results: There were 31 caregivers randomized and 28 completers. There was a significant effect on RMBPC by group covarying for baseline RMBPC, with both active interventions showing improvement compared with the respite-only group. Most of the secondary outcome measures were not significantly affected by the interventions. There was an intervention effect on the caregiver self-efficacy measure and on cognitive measures. Although mindfulness was not impacted by the intervention, there were significant correlations between mindfulness and self-rated mood and stress scores.Conclusions: Both mindfulness and education interventions decreased the self-rated caregiver stress compared to the respite-only control.",0
Evaluation of driving ability among residents after the duty shift,"Introduction and aims: Medical residents in training have long work shifts that lead increases the risk of traffic accidents. The Asde Driver Test is a test battery with equipment homologated by the Spanish traffic authorities designed to assess psychological and physical aptitude for obtaining the driving license in Spain. We study whether driving ability is objectively affected in this test.Materials and methods: The Asde Driver Test was applied before and in the morning after duty The data were evaluated using the SPSS statistical package, analyzing the variations in score with the Student t-test for paired samples. The results were also compared with the validated assessment criteria of the class B driving license test, based on passing of the cutoff points for each analyzed variable. Subjects with physical limitations precluding test conduction were excluded, as were those with a resting period during the duty shift of over 4 h.Results: Of the 25 residents, 22 cases were therefore included in the data analysis. There were no significant differences in the paired global pre- and post-duty comparison of results, though there were cases in which the results obtained after duty fell short of the recommended criteria for passing the aptitude test.Comments: The Asde Driver Test includes tests relating to anticipation speed, bimanual visual-motor coordination, multiple reaction times, concentrated attention, and resistance to monotony. The results obtained show that fatigue in some cases, though not on a generalized basis, adversely affects skills needed for driving, such as reaction time, resistance to monotony, anticipation speed, or visual-motor coordination.In conclusion, following the resident duty shift, impaired driving ability is observed in some cases that could increase the risk of traffic accidents.

Monitoring System for Fatigue Driving based on The Internet of Things,"Fatigue driving is a serious problem for human life and economy. In this paper, an alertness of fatigue driving estimating system was designed based on the internet of things with personal computer, 6410-ARM developed platform and the combination of GPS, GPRS and Zibgee peripheral modules. We also proposed the framework of algorithm, which is called dynamic sliding window detection, to distinguish level of fatigue state. With the real-time communication between monitoring center and vehicle terminal, it is able to keep the local and remote alarm, monitor vehicle information in remote, and deliver early warning signal to other vehicle around.",1
Height of Driver's Eye and Taillight Measurements from a Camera-Based Roadside Setup,"This paper presents an approach that can be used to measure height of driver's eyes and rear position lamps from a video, i.e., two important metrics used to set sight distance standards. This data plays an important role in the definition of geometric design of highways and streets. Our method automatically estimates the camera pose with respect to the road. It then requires selecting two points to obtain the height. New vehicles tend to be higher and larger. Consequently, this information shoud be updated. This approach has been applied on a large panel of vehicles. Our method was evaluated on vehicle height measurements. Our results suggest that our method achieves less than 1.8 cm (0.7 in) mean absolute error. Our experiments show an increase in the height of driver's eyes and taillights.",0
Wheelchair skills training programme for children: A pilot study,"Aim: Wheelchair skills are not typically provided when a child gets a new wheelchair. The purpose of this prospective pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of a two-day modified Wheelchair Skills Programme 3.2 for children.Methods: Six children (ages 6-19 years) with spinal cord injuries or spina bifida were invited to participate in a two-day wheelchair skills programme provided on subsequent Saturdays. Children were tested before and after training using a modified Wheelchair Skills Test 3.2. To assess for the effect of the programme on participation, the Activity Skills for Kids was used before and one month after training. For a more qualitative reflection, an Impact Questionnaire was given at four months post-training.Results: There was a significant (14%) increase in skills based on the Wheelchair Skills Test 3.2. No change in participation was measured with the Activity Skills for Kids. The Impact Questionnaire suggests the skill training allowed participants to do more, with less pain and fatigue post-training.Conclusions: A two-day wheelchair skills programme can potentially improve skill level in children with spinal cord injuries or spina bifida.",0
Effects of Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation on Upper Airway Structure and Function Using Moving Wall Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations: A Pilot Study,"Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) is an innovative alternative treatment option for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in patients unable to tolerate continuous positive airway pressure. However, the success rate of HGNS is variable, but the reasons underlying variation in treatment efficacy are not well understood. In this pilot study of three male subjects, we propose an innovative, non-invasive method to quantify the structural and functional changes to the upper airway that occur with HGNS. We used four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of respiratory airflow to quantify how HGNS changes: (1) airway cross-sectional area (CSA), (2) work done by muscles and air pressure in dilating and collapsing the airway and (3) airway resistance. Subjects underwent 4DCT under natural stage non-REM 2 (N2) sleep with and without HGNS. Each patient had concurrent electroencephalograms and airflow measurements. CFD simulations were performed based on anatomy and airway motion from 4DCT images and airflow data. HGNS was associated with an increase in neuromuscular work done in dilating the airway (up to 490%); airway CSA increased by up to 300%. Most motion with HGNS occurred in the oropharynx; changes in the nasopharynx and hypopharynx varied between subjects. Minute ventilation increased in all subjects (15%-36%). Airway resistance decreased across the three subjects (73%-97%). Quantifying the parameters measured in this study may help explain variable responses to HGNS as a treatment for OSA. These procedures may, in future, help predict non-responders to HGNS, isolate reasons for poor responses, or inform device titration.",0
A Hybrid Approach to Detect Driver Drowsiness Utilizing Physiological Signals to Improve System Performance and Wearability,"Driver drowsiness is a major cause of fatal accidents, injury, and property damage, and has become an area of substantial research attention in recent years. The present study proposes a method to detect drowsiness in drivers which integrates features of electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) to improve detection performance. The study measures differences between the alert and drowsy states from physiological data collected from 22 healthy subjects in a driving simulator-based study. A monotonous driving environment is used to induce drowsiness in the participants. Various time and frequency domain feature were extracted from EEG including time domain statistical descriptors, complexity measures and power spectral measures. Features extracted from the ECG signal included heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), including low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio. Furthermore, subjective sleepiness scale is also assessed to study its relationship with drowsiness. We used paired t-tests to select only statistically significant features (p < 0.05), that can differentiate between the alert and drowsy states effectively. Significant features of both modalities (EEG and ECG) are then combined to investigate the improvement in performance using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The other main contribution of this paper is the study on channel reduction and its impact to the performance of detection. The proposed method demonstrated that combining EEG and ECG has improved the system's performance in discriminating between alert and drowsy states, instead of using them alone. Our channel reduction analysis revealed that an acceptable level of accuracy (80%) could be achieved by combining just two electrodes (one EEG and one ECG), indicating the feasibility of a system with improved wearability compared with existing systems involving many electrodes. Overall, our results demonstrate that the proposed method can be a viable solution for a practical driver drowsiness system that is both accurate and comfortable to wear.",1
A systematic review of physiological signals based driver drowsiness detection systems,"Driving a vehicle is a complex, multidimensional, and potentially risky activity demanding full mobilization and utilization of physiological and cognitive abilities. Drowsiness, often caused by stress, fatigue, and illness declines cognitive capabilities that affect drivers' capability and cause many accidents. Drowsiness-related road accidents are associated with trauma, physical injuries, and fatalities, and often accompany economic loss. Drowsy-related crashes are most common in young people and night shift workers. Real-time and accurate driver drowsiness detection is necessary to bring down the drowsy driving accident rate. Many researchers endeavored for systems to detect drowsiness using different features related to vehicles, and drivers' behavior, as well as, physiological measures. Keeping in view the rising trend in the use of physiological measures, this study presents a comprehensive and systematic review of the recent techniques to detect driver drowsiness using physiological signals. Different sensors augmented with machine learning are utilized which subsequently yield better results. These techniques are analyzed with respect to several aspects such as data collection sensor, environment consideration like controlled or dynamic, experimental set up like real traffic or driving simulators, etc. Similarly, by investigating the type of sensors involved in experiments, this study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of existing studies and points out the research gaps. Perceptions and conceptions are made to provide future research directions for drowsiness detection techniques based on physiological signals.",1
Detecting mental fatigue from eye-tracking data gathered while watching video: Evaluation in younger and older adults,"Health monitoring technology in everyday situations is expected to improve quality of life and support aging populations. Mental fatigue among health indicators of individuals has become important due to its association with cognitive performance and health outcomes, especially in older adults. Previous models using eye-tracking measures allow inference of fatigue during cognitive tasks, such as driving, but they require us to engage in specific cognitive tasks. In addition, previous models were mainly tested by user groups that did not include older adults, although age-related changes in eye-tracking measures have been reported especially in older adults. Here, we propose a model to detect mental fatigue of younger and older adults in natural viewing situations. Our model includes two unique aspects: (i) novel feature sets to better capture fatigue in natural viewing situations and (ii) an automated feature selection method to select a feature subset enabling the model to be robust to the target's age. To test our model, we collected eye-tracking data from younger and older adults as they watched video clips before and after performing cognitive tasks. Our model improved detection accuracy by up to 13.9% compared with a model based on the previous studies, achieving 91.0% accuracy (chance 50%).",1
Sleep misalignment and circadian rhythm impairment in long-haul bus drivers under a two-up operations system,"Objectives: The objective of the study was to describe working and sleep conditions and to assess how sleep opportunities are associated with obtained sleep and alertness, in a sample of long-haul bus drivers working with a two-up operations system.Methods: Measures of subjective sleep and sleepiness, actigraphy, circadian temperature rhythm, and psychomotor vigilance tasks were obtained from a sample of 122 drivers from Argentina. Variables were compared between high and low fatigue risk groups, which were formed using a median split of a fatigue risk score. The score was calculated based on drivers' total working hours, maximum shift duration, minimum short break duration, maximum night work per seven days, and long break frequencies.Results: Considering a standardized one-day period, sleep in the bus accounted for 1.9 +/- 0.1 h of total sleep (57 1% efficiency), sleep at destination for 1.6 +/- 0.2 h of total sleep (90 +/- 1% efficiency), and sleep al home for 3.8+0.2 h of total sleep (89 +/- 1% nap efficiency and 90 1% anchor sleep efficiency). In drivers exposed to high-risk working schedules, the circadian temperature rhythm was weaker (lower % of variance explained by the model) (22.0 +/- 1.7% vs. 27.6+2.0%, p <0.05) and without a significant acrophase.Conclusions: Drivers obtained a total amount of weekly sleep similar to the recommended levels for adults, but distributed at different locations and at different times during the day. High-risk working schedules were associated with disruption of circadian temperature rhythms. These results point out to the need of the implementation of shift-work scheduling strategies to minimize sleep misalignment and circadian desynchronization in long-haul bus drivers.

Supportive Smart Home Systems: Utilization Assessment for Internet Service Provider Networks,"The use of residence-based well-being assessment through ambient and, in some cases, wearable sensors has led to many research projects for residential monitoring systems and supportive smart homes that are connected over the Internet to cloud processing. Many of these systems have been pilot tested and some early examples are entering commercial release. This report focuses on a key aspect for scaled use that has not been extensively considered which is the telecommunications provider network between the residence and the cloud. This work reports a 10-fold difference in network traffic generated between systems performing the same functionality and predominance of very small packets which must be routed. The project compares two smart home systems providing well-being monitoring and two smart bed sensors that assess vital signs and sleep. The results show how the design of sensing systems can vary greatly and that widespread deployment, such as many residences in a multi-tenant building, will force consideration of these effects within the telecommunication provider services.",0
Coupled hydromechanical analysis of sparsely fractured crystalline rocks,"This paper addresses the issue of evolution and coalescence of localized damage zones in sparsely fractured crystalline rocks. The approach incorporates a constitutive law with embedded discontinuity, which is phrased in terms of both the hydraulic and mechanical response. The formulation takes into account the hydromechanical interaction in regions intercepted by discontinuities. An internal length scale parameter is employed in the definition of equivalent hydraulic conductivity and the tangential stiffness operators, and the onset of newly developed macrocracks is detected by the bifurcation analysis. An enhanced mixed u-p finite element formulation is derived which considers the effect of progressive evolution of the fracture aperture in the weak statements of balance equations. Fully implicit temporal discretization is employed, and the finite element formulation is stabilized by invoking the Polynomial-Pressure-Projection (PPP) technique. A coupled FE analysis is conducted examining the response of Luc du Bonnet granite, with pre-existing fracture network, subjected to plane strain compression that triggers the crack propagation and coalescence. The approach is first verified on some benchmark problems that involve the presence of a dominant fracture. The results of simulations are compared with those obtained using a very fine mesh incorporating interface elements. Later, a series of coupled analyses are carried out examining the hydromechanical response in the presence of multiple fractures.",0
Vocal Performance of Group Fitness Instructors Before and After Instruction: Changes in Acoustic Measures and Self-Ratings,"Objectives. (1) To quantify acute changes in acoustic parameters of the voices of group fitness instructors (GFIs) before and after exercise instruction. (2) To determine whether these changes are discernible perceptually by the instructor.Study Design. This is a pilot prospective cohort study.Methods. Participants were six female GFIs, based in Brisbane, Australia. Participants performed a series of vocal tasks before and after instruction of a 60-minute exercise class. Data were obtained pertaining to fundamental frequency (pitch), intensity (volume), jitter, shimmer, harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), maximum duration of sustained phonation (MDSP), and pitch range. Additionally, self-ratings of voice quality were obtained before and after instruction. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.Results. Significant increases (P <= 0.05) were found in fundamental frequency and intensity after instruction. No significant changes in jitter, shimmer, HNR, or MDSP were found before and after instruction. For the group, no significant change in self-ratings of voice quality occurred before and after instruction.Conclusions. Statistically significant changes in pitch and volume were found on acoustic analysis. However, these subtle changes remained within the limits of what is considered normal and representative of the participant's age and gender. Further research into the effects of exercise instruction on the voice is needed.",0
Trends and Future Prospects of the Drowsiness Detection and Estimation Technology,"Drowsiness is among the important factors that cause traffic accidents; therefore, a monitoring system is necessary to detect the state of a driver's drowsiness. Driver monitoring systems usually detect three types of information: biometric information, vehicle behavior, and driver's graphic information. This review summarizes the research and development trends of drowsiness detection systems based on various methods. Drowsiness detection methods based on the three types of information are discussed. A prospect for arousal level detection and estimation technology for autonomous driving is also presented. In the case of autonomous driving levels 4 and 5, where the driver is not the primary driving agent, the technology will not be used to detect and estimate wakefulness for accident prevention; rather, it can be used to ensure that the driver has enough sleep to arrive comfortably at the destination.",0
A randomised controlled cross-over double-blind pilot study protocol on THC: CBD oromucosal spray efficacy as an add-on therapy for post-stroke spasticity,"Introduction Stroke is the most disabling neurological disorder and often causes spasticity. Transmucosal cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol (THC: CBD), Sativex) is currently available to treat spasticity-associated symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis. Cannabinoids are being considered useful also in the treatment of pain, nausea and epilepsy, but may bear and increased risk for cardiovascular events. Spasticity is often assessed with subjective and clinical rating scales, which are unable to measure the increased excitability of the monosynaptic reflex, considered the hallmark of spasticity. The neurophysiological assessment of the stretch reflex provides a precise and objective method to measure spasticity. We propose a novel study to understand if Sativex could be useful in reducing spasticity in stroke survivors and investigating tolerability and safety by accurate cardiovascular monitoring.Methods and analysis We will recruit 50 patients with spasticity following stroke to take THC: CBD in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study. Spasticity will be assessed with a numeric rating scale for spasticity, the modified Ashworth scale and with the electromyographical recording of the stretch reflex. The cardiovascular risk will be assessed prior to inclusion. Blood pressure, heart rate, number of daily spasms, bladder function, sleep disruption and adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. A mixed-model analysis of variance will be used to compare the stretch reflex amplitude between the time points; semiquantitative measures will be compared using the Mann-Whitney test (THC: CBD vs placebo) and Wilcoxon test (baseline vs treatment).Ethics and dissemination The study was registered on the EudraCT database with number 2016-001034-10 and approved by both the Italian Medicines Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) and local Ethics Committee 'Comitato Etico Regionale della Liguria'. Data will be made anonymous and uploaded to a open access repository. Results will be disseminated by presentations at national and international conferences and by publication in journals of clinical neuroscience and neurology.",0
Looks are (almost) everything: Where drivers look to get information,"Objective: To describe the impact of Rockwell's early eye movements research. Background: The advent of a new technology enabling measurements of eye movements in natural environments launched the seminal research of a Human Factors pioneer, Tom Rockwell, into how drivers process visual information. Method: In two seminal Human Factors articles - Mapping Eye-Movement Pattern to the Visual Scene in Driving: An Exploratory Study (Mourant & Rockwell, 1970) and Strategies of Visual Search by Novice and Experienced Drivers (Mourant & Rockwell, 1972) - Rockwell and his student, Ron Mourant, examined drivers' eye movements in naturalistic driving environments. Results: The analyses of the visual fixations revealed systematic relationships between the sources of information the drivers needed to drive safely and the spatial distributions of their visual fixations. In addition, they showed that as drivers gain skill and experience, their pattern of fixations changes in a systematic manner. Conclusions: The research demonstrated that fixations and saccadic eye movements provide important insights into drivers' visual search behavior, information needs, and information acquisition processes. Application: This research has been a cornerstone for a myriad of driving-related studies, by Rockwell and other researchers. Building on Rockwell's pioneering work, these studies used eye-tracking systems to describe cognitive aspects of skill acquisition, and the effects of fatigue and other impairments on the process of attention and information gathering. A novel and potentially revolutionary application of this research is to use eye movement recordings for vehicle control and activation of in-vehicle safety systems.",0
A Study on Warning System About Drowsy Status of Driver,"A warning system about drowsy status (fatigue or drowsiness) of the driver, helping to limit the traffic accidents caused by falling asleep behind the wheel by determining the status of the eyes combined with the head direction of driver. In this paper, we present a novel approach for determining the position of a human face and eyes in different directions of the face (turning left, turning right, tilt left, tilt right, looked-up, broke-down), using ASM model. Besides, we suggested an improved algorithm to detect and identify the status of the eyes to support the driver during driving. This algorithm consists of three main steps: (1) enhance the brightness of the image area contains two eyes using color spaces and median filter processing; (2) the image area contains two eye was extracted by a method of morphologies and image segmentation with dynamic threshold; (3) finally, the status of the eyes is determined by using SVM classifier based on HOG feature. Next, the direction of the driver's head is estimated by combining the 3D head model and algorithms posit to increase the effectiveness of the warning system. Our tested is performed with the data which was set by our (3778 photos of eyes of 9 people). Testing accuracy achieved is 97.86% and the average recognition time is 0.106s/image frame. Testing accuracy confirms the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed system.",1
Pupil light reflex evoked by light-emitting diode and computer screen: Methodology and association with need for recovery in daily life,"ObjectivesPupil light reflex (PLR) has been widely used as a method for evaluating parasympathetic activity. The first aim of the present study is to develop a PLR measurement using a computer screen set-up and compare its results with the PLR generated by a more conventional setup using light-emitting diode (LED). The parasympathetic nervous system, which is known to control the 'rest and digest' response of the human body, is considered to be associated with daily life fatigue. However, only few studies have attempted to test the relationship between self-reported daily fatigue and physiological measurement of the parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between daily-life fatigue, assessed using the Need for Recovery scale, and parasympathetic activity, as indicated by the PLR parameters.DesignA pilot study was conducted first to develop a PLR measurement set-up using a computer screen. PLRs evoked by light stimuli with different characteristics were recorded to confirm the influence of light intensity, flash duration, and color on the PLRs evoked by the system. In the subsequent experimental study, we recorded the PLR of 25 adult participants to light flashes generated by the screen set-up as well as by a conventional LED set-up. PLR parameters relating to parasympathetic and sympathetic activity were calculated from the pupil responses. We tested the split-half reliability across two consecutive blocks of trials, and the relationships between the parameters of PLRs evoked by the two set-ups. Participants rated their need for recovery prior to the PLR recordings.ResultsPLR parameters acquired in the screen and LED set-ups showed good reliability for amplitude related parameters. The PLRs evoked by both set-ups were consistent, but showed systematic differences in absolute values of all parameters. Additionally, higher need for recovery was associated with faster and larger constriction of the PLR.ConclusionsThis study assessed the PLR generated by a computer screen and the PLR generated by a LED. The good reliability within set-ups and the consistency between the PLRs evoked by the set-ups indicate that both systems provides a valid way to evoke the PLR. A higher need for recovery was associated with faster and larger constricting PLRs, suggesting increased levels of parasympathetic nervous system activity in people experiencing higher levels of need for recovery on a daily basis.",0
Diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Using Pulse Oximeter Derived Photoplethysmographic Signals,"Objectives: Increasing awareness of the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its impact on health in conjunction with high cost, inconvenience, and short supply of in-lab polysomnography (PSG) has led to the development of more convenient, affordable, and accessible diagnostic devices. We evaluated the reliability and accuracy of a single-channel (finger pulse-oximetry) photoplethysmography (PPG)-based device for detection of OSA (Morpheus Ox).Methods: Among a cohort of 73 patients referred for in-laboratory evaluation of OSA, 65 were simultaneously monitored with the PPG based device while undergoing PSG. Among these, 19 had significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Using the PSG as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), as well as the positive likelihood ratio (+LR) for an apnea hypopnea index (AHI)(PSG) > 5/h and AHI(PSG) > 15/h were calculated for the PPG.Results: Valid results were available for 65 subjects. Mean age: 52.1 +/- 14.2, Male: 52%, and BMI: 36.3 +/- 9.7 kg/m(2). Positive correlation was found between PPG-derived and PSG-derived AHI (r = 0.81, p < 0.001). For AHI(PSG) > 5/h, sensitivity was 80%, specificity 86%, PPV 93%, NPV 68%, and +LR was 5.9. For AHI(PSG) > 15/h, sensitivity was 70%, specificity 91%, PPV 80%, NPV 85%, and +LR was 7.83. The corresponding areas under the receiver operator curves were 0.91 and 0.9.Conclusions: PPG-derived data compare well with simultaneous in-lab PSG in the diagnosis of suspected OSA among patients with and without cardiopulmonary comorbidities.",0
"Identification of Rtl1, a Retrotransposon-Derived Imprinted Gene, as a Novel Driver of Hepatocarcinogenesis","We previously utilized a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis screen to discover novel drivers of HCC. This approach identified recurrent mutations within the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted domain, indicating that alteration of one or more elements within the domain provides a selective advantage to cells during the process of hepatocarcinogenesis. For the current study, we performed transcriptome and small RNA sequencing to profile gene expression in SB-induced HCCs in an attempt to clarify the genetic element(s) contributing to tumorigenesis. We identified strong induction of Retrotransposon-like 1 (Rtl1) expression as the only consistent alteration detected in all SB-induced tumors with Dlk1-Dio3 integrations, suggesting that Rtl1 activation serves as a driver of HCC. While previous studies have identified correlations between disrupted expression of multiple Dlk1-Dio3 domain members and HCC, we show here that direct modulation of a single domain member, Rtl1, can promote hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo. Overexpression of Rtl1 in the livers of adult mice using a hydrodynamic gene delivery technique resulted in highly penetrant (86%) tumor formation. Additionally, we detected overexpression of RTL1 in 30% of analyzed human HCC samples, indicating the potential relevance of this locus as a therapeutic target for patients. The Rtl1 locus is evolutionarily derived from the domestication of a retrotransposon. In addition to identifying Rtl1 as a novel driver of HCC, our study represents one of the first direct in vivo demonstrations of a role for such a co-opted genetic element in promoting carcinogenesis.",0
Vibratory splint therapy for decreasing sleep clenching: A pilot study,"Objective To estimate the effect of a vibratory splint (VibS) in reducing sleep clenching (SC) and TMD pain. Methods Target sample was consecutive 19 TMD patients attending the Orofacial Pain Clinic at FFO-FOUSP. Patients used the VibS or acrylic occlusal splint (OS) as control for 14 days. Outcome variables were SC frequency and pain, assessed by a portable electromyography detector-analyzer (BiteStrip (TM)) and 100 mm VAS, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed with two-way repeated measures ANOVA, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results VibS promoted a marked decrease, whereas acrylic OS increased SC frequency after two weeks of use. Due to a significant difference in initial VAS levels between VibS and control group, the effect of the two splints on TMD pain could not be clearly estimated. Conclusion The results suggested that VibS can potentially be used to reduce SC frequency, although further studies with larger sample size are necessary to confirm these findings.",0
"A pilot study comparing ergonomics in laparoscopy and robotics: beyond anecdotes, and subjective claims.","We aimed to use hand dexterity and grip strength test as objective measures to compare the difference in surgeon fatigue associated with robotic and laparoscopic colorectal surgery. We used the Purdue Pegboard Test to assess hand dexterity and the Camry Electronic Handgrip Dynamometer to assess hand grip strength. Eighteen patients were operated on, including 10 robotic and 8 laparoscopic cases. Statistical analysis revealed no difference in dexterity or muscle fatigue after operating with the robot. In contrast, there was a significant difference in the hand grip strength of both hands after laparoscopic surgery. Our results show that the resultant fatigue after laparoscopy affects both hands of the surgeon. In contrast, there was no difference in dexterity or muscle fatigue after operating with the robot. Given the demands of complex colorectal surgeries, robotics may be a means of optimizing surgeon performance by reducing fatigue.",0
"A risk assessment model for traffic crashes problem using fuzzy logic: a case study of Zonguldak, Turkey","In this Fuzzy Inference System based study, a model is developed which can present a real-time risk assessment model to the drivers. The model includes parameters car speed, accident frequency, weather conditions, tire tread depth and fatigue. In order to evaluate the performance of the model, the road between Zonguldak and Duzce is chosen, which has a high accident incidence and can cause anxiety on the drivers. The statistical results of the real and artificial data sets that were created to demonstrate the model performance were found as follows; Mean Square Error is 5.07551 for real and 6.43029 for artificial data set, Mean Absolute Error is 1.8 and 1.69864, Correlation Coefficient is 95.594% and 97.412%, and Determination Coefficient is 84.98% and 93.6% respectively. Investigation of the actual accidents reveals that the accident risk ratios in these accidents were between 60% and 80% according to the determined parameters.",1
"Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation During Sedation with Dexmedetomidine (CLASS-D): Protocol for a Within-Subject, Crossover, Controlled, Interventional Trial with Healthy Volunteers","Introduction: The relative power of slow-delta oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG), termed slow-wave activity (SWA), correlates with level of unconsciousness. Acoustic enhancement of SWA has been reported for sleep states, but it remains unknown if pharmacologically induced SWA can be enhanced using sound. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative whose EEG oscillations resemble those of natural sleep. This pilot study was designed to investigate whether SWA can be enhanced using closed-loop acoustic stimulation during sedation (CLASS) with dexmedetomidine.Methods: Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation during Sedation with Dexmedetomidine (CLASS-D) is a within-subject, crossover, controlled, interventional trial with healthy volunteers. Each participant will be sedated with a dexmedetomidine target-controlled infusion (TCI). Participants will undergo three CLASS conditions in a multiple crossover design: in-phase (phase-locked to slow-wave upslopes), anti-phase (phase-locked to slow-wave downslopes) and sham (silence). High-density EEG recordings will assess the effects of CLASS across the scalp. A volitional behavioral task and sequential thermal arousals will assess the anesthetic effects of CLASS. Ambulatory sleep studies will be performed on nights immediately preceding and following the sedation session. EEG effects of CLASS will be assessed using linear mixed-effects models. The impacts of CLASS on behavior and arousal thresholds will be assessed using logistic regression modeling. Parametric modeling will determine differences in sleepiness and measures of sleep homeostasis before and after sedation.Results: The primary outcome of this pilot study is the effect of CLASS on EEG slow waves. Secondary outcomes include the effects of CLASS on the following: performance of a volitional task, arousal thresholds, and subsequent sleep.Discussion: This investigation will elucidate 1) the potential of exogenous sensory stimulation to potentiate SWA during sedation; 2) the physiologic significance of this intervention; and 3) the connection between EEG slow-waves observed during sleep and sedation.",0
Adherence to the American Cancer Society Head and Neck Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline According to Chart Review: A Nested Retrospective Cohort Pilot Study,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore adherence to the American Cancer Society (ACS) Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) Survivorship Care Guideline and their outlined 33 recommendations among posttreatment HNC survivors. Methods: A bi-institutional, retrospective, nested cohort study of mucosal or salivary gland HNC survivors diagnosed in 2018 was designed. Guideline adherence was assessed via retrospective chart review between 0 and 13 months after completion of oncologic treatment according to 4 categories: (1) problem assessed, (2) problem diagnosed, (3) management offered; (4) problem treated. Adherence was defined as meeting a recommendation subcategory at least once over the 13-month period. Results: Among 60 randomly selected HNC survivors, a total of 38 were included in the final cohort after exclusion of individuals with ineligible cancers and those who died or were lost to follow-up over the study period. Approximately 95% of HNC survivors were assessed for HNC recurrence and screened for lung cancer. Certain common problems such as xerostomia, dysphagia, and hypothyroidism were screened for and managed in >= 70% of eligible survivors. Conversely, screening for other second primary cancers and assessment of a majority of other physical and psychosocial harms occurred in <70% of survivors, and in many cases none to a slim minority of survivors (eg, sleep apnea and sleep disturbance, body and self-image concerns). Only 5% of survivors received a survivorship care plan. Conclusion: Overall adherence to the ACS HNC Survivorship Care Guideline in early posttreatment survivors was suboptimal. Interventions are needed to better implement and operationalize these guideline recommendations.",0
REAL-TIME FLOOD MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF A MISSISSIPPI RIVER PIPELINE CROSSING,"Enbridge Liquids Pipelines (Enbridge) operates over 26,000 km of liquid pipelines in Canada and the US, administers a system-wide geohazard management program to identify, investigate and monitor geohazards, and performs remediation as required. An integral part of the geohazard management program is real-time flood monitoring, where pipeline watercourse crossings affected by flooding are identified and flood levels monitored. Watercourse crossings where the pipelines have a high potential to become exposed, to span, and potentially to fail during a flood event are studied in more detail.This flood monitoring program automatically monitors publicly available real-time stream gauge flow measurements and compares these measurements to estimated discharge thresholds for the crossing under evaluation. Thresholds are related to the current pipeline depth of cover (DOC) and the amount of scour that can occur over a range of flood magnitudes. Thresholds include: 1) the estimated peak flow to expose the top of the pipe, exposure flow, 2) the estimated peak discharge and associated flow velocities that could create enough free spanning pipe for the onset of vortex induced vibration (VIV) fatigue failure, flow of concern, and 3) where additional mechanical assessment taking account of specific pipe properties, data requirements and circumstances has been carried out, the critical flow, the estimated average peak flow and duration that has the potential to result in product release due to VIV once a sufficient pipe span length has developed, critical flow.This paper is a case study of an assessment and flood monitoring of one of Enbridge's Mississippi River pipeline crossings, which has a history of flood-related pipeline exposure and subsequent mitigations. During real-time monitoring of a 2015 flood event the exposure flow and flow of concern thresholds for this crossing were exceeded, resulting in a decision by Enbridge to shut down the pipeline. Subsequent surveys revealed that the pipe had become exposed and was spanning adjacent to the previously remediated area. The previous mitigation likely limited the length of pipe exposure and pipe span. Added complexity was encountered during the post shutdown DOC survey, which needed to be completed as quickly and safely as possible after flood levels declined to allow for an assessment of the actual condition of the pipeline prior to restart.This paper presents a methodology that could allow pipeline operators to identify river crossings susceptible to pipe exposure, and the potential for freespan development, due to flooding, by providing an understanding of what is likely happening to the cover over the pipe at a particular crossing during a flood event. This provides a tool to better manage pipeline river crossings experiencing flooding.As far as the authors are aware, this case study represents the first time a pipeline has been shut down based on real-time flows and thresholds in the United States.",0
Effects of mindfulness meditation and Acceptance and commitment therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea with residual excessive sleepiness: A randomized controlled pilot study,"Objective: Assessing the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on symptoms of OSA, especially on the primary outcome, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).Methods: Parallel randomized controlled trial. 16 OSA patients with residual EDS (rEDS) were random-ized and assigned to either a standardized 8-week MBSR program or a time-matched program on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Both programs were conducted online. Participants answered questionnaires online at baseline (pre), post-intervention (post), three months after the intervention (follow-up) and were blinded to whether their group was the treatment or active control group but not to group allocation (partial blinding). Three participants dropped out early. Most analyses are based on the remaining 13 patients.Results: There was a significant difference between the MBSR (n = 7) and ACT group (n = 6) in changes of EDS between pre and post (Cohen's d = 1.24, CI [0.01, 2.42]) and a significant reduction of EDS for pa-tients in the ACT group at post (Cohen's d = 1.18 and [0.08, 2.22]). This EDS reduction averaging 2.17 points on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale reached the prespecified bar for clinical significance of two points on that scale. Insomnia symptoms, a secondary outcome, reduced significantly following ACT (Cohen's d = 1.43 [0.23, 2.58]). In MBSR, both participants and the MBSR-trainer judged movement-based exer-cises to be most efficacious.Conclusion: ACT shows potential as adjunctive therapy for OSA with rEDS, although further studies are needed. It seems promising to develop therapeutic approaches for OSA with rEDS using ACT, especially if they are tailored to the needs specific to this patient group.

Detecting mental states of alertness with genetic algorithm variable selection,"The objective of the present work is to develop a method able to automatically determine mental states of vigilance; i.e., a person's state of alertness. Such a task is relevant to diverse domains, where a person is expected or required to be in a particular state. For instance, pilots or medical staffs are expected to be in a highly alert state, and this method could help to detect possible problems. In this paper, an approach is developed to predict the state of alertness (normal or relaxed) from the study of electroencephalographic signals (EEG) collected with a limited number of electrodes. The EEG of 58 participants in the two alertness states (116 records) were collected via a cap with 58 electrodes. After a data validation step, 19 subjects were retained for further analysis. A genetic algorithm was used to select an optimal subset of electrodes. Common spatial pattern (CSP) coupled to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to build a decision rule and thus predict the alertness of the participants. Different subset sizes were investigated and the best result was obtained by considering 9 electrodes (correct classification rate of 73.68%).",0
Fatigue life investigation of the 15 μm thick ThELMA™ epitaxial polysilicon,"This work deals with the investigation of the fatigue characteristics of the industrial 15 mu m thick ThELMA (TM) epitaxial polysilicon, used by STMicroelectronics for the development of their commercial products. The aim was to supply the customer with the reliability limits of this structural material during the practical usage. Tests were applied to 1 DoF Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) which contains flexure hinges and which is actuated by a rotate comb finger driver. The testing methodology bases on the monitoring of the Device Current (DC), which is proportional to the actuator oscillation. An indirect control of the system operation was then possible and the sample-breaking event was registered by electrical measurements. By acquiring the 2nd or the 1st harmonic of the output signal, either single tests at wafer level or parallel measurements via hardware were taken respectively. The experimental results are here presented and compared to the literature data, based on a critical discussion on the up-to-date fatigue failure mechanisms investigated on MEMS. The computed slope of the relative strength reduction to the number of cycles to failure (S-N curve) is -0.0175. It follows similar trend extracted by literature data performed in different loading conditions of frequency, thus supporting the not time depending failure mechanism theory.",0
A pilot study of an Enhanced Mental Health Assessment during routine and discharge medicals in the British Armed Forces,"Objectives A pilot study to assess the practicality of introducing an enhanced mental health assessment (EMHA) into all routine and discharge medicals of the UK Armed Forces in order to facilitate treatment prior to and on return to civilian life.Methods A pilot study was conducted using an EMHA questionnaire with questions about depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use, sleep and anger/irritability. At pilot sites, the EMHA was completed during all routine and discharge medicals between May 2011 and July 2011. At the end of the study period, qualitative data were collected from participating medical officers and practice managers regarding their opinions about the pilot study.Results The quantitative data revealed an average pick-up rate for mental health (MH) problems. Out of the four military medical centres who participated and the 325 questionnaires collected, one referral to a Department of Community Mental Health was made. 26 (8%) patients were categorised as 'some concern and patient offered advice and/or reassurance'. The vast majority of patients were found to have no evidence of MH problems. However, using a validated alcohol screening tool, 64% of service personnel were found to have a score indicating 'higher risk drinking'. Analysis of the qualitative data suggests that the EMHA is an easy tool to implement with minimal additional time and resources needed. The interviewees pointed out a number of limitations and suggestions for possible further studies.Conclusions The pilot study successfully demonstrated that the EMHA questionnaire is easy to administer, does not take up a large amount of additional resources or manpower and provides a useful check of MH status. The study picked up an average number of MH cases and the questions on alcohol consumption highlighted that military personnel may be at a 'higher risk of drinking'.",0
STDD: Short-Term Depression Detection with Passive Sensing,"It has recently been reported that identifying the depression severity of a person requires involvement of mental health professionals who use traditional methods like interviews and self-reports, which results in spending time and money. In this work we made solid contributions on short-term depression detection using every-day mobile devices. To improve the accuracy of depression detection, we extracted five factors influencing depression (symptom clusters) from the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), namely, physical activity, mood, social activity, sleep, and food intake and extracted features related to each symptom cluster from mobile devices' sensors. We conducted an experiment, where we recruited 20 participants from four different depression groups based on PHQ-9 (the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the 9-item depression module from the full PHQ), which are normal, mildly depressed, moderately depressed, and severely depressed and built a machine learning model for automatic classification of depression category in a short period of time. To achieve the aim of short-term depression classification, we developed Short-Term Depression Detector (STDD), a framework that consisted of a smartphone and a wearable device that constantly reported the metrics (sensor data and self-reports) to perform depression group classification.

"Sleep quality in children with hepatic glycogen storage diseases, a prospective observational pilot study.","Background: Hepatic glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are characterised by enzyme defects affecting liver glycogen metabolism, where carbohydrate supplementation to prevent overnight hypoglycaemia is common. Concerns around sleep quality in hepatic GSDs relate to emerging evidence that overnight dysglycaemia impacts sleep quality.Methods: This prospective observational study reported sleep quality and duration in children with hepatic GSDs over 7days utilising: actigraphy (Actiwatch 2 by Phillips Respironics), sleep diaries, proxy reported age-appropriate sleep and quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires, in the context of nocturnal glycaemic profiles continuous glucose monitor (CGM, Dexcom G6) and nocturnal dietary management strategies. Significant hypo- and hyperglycaemia were defined as ≥1% of sleep diary documented nocturnal period, recording <3.5 and >10.0mmol/L, respectively.Results: Seven children with hepatic GSD (aged 1-17years) participated. Objective sleep quality was poor, with actigraphy demonstrating that no child achieved the minimum sleep duration recommended for age. Subjective sleep quality was also poor, with 4/5 documenting significant daytime sleepiness and 6/6 reporting poor sleep hygiene. Children prescribed overnight bolus feeds (OBF) (n=2) recorded shorter sleep duration compared to other nocturnal management strategies. Parent-reported QoL suggested poor disease-related QoL outcomes for this cohort.Conclusion: Objective and subjective sleep disturbances and reduced QoL are common within our sample of children with hepatic GSD. From our observations these outcomes may be linked to nutritional overnight interventions, especially OBFs, rather than overnight glucose levels. Consideration of the impacts of overnight feeding strategies on sleep quality and QoL in children with hepatic GSD should inform future management strategies.",0
A pilot study using pre-treatment physical activity level to predict long-term health-related quality of life in patients with head and neck cancer,"BackgroundPre-treatment levels of physical activity (PA) in head and neck cancer (HNC) are rarely evaluated using accelerometry. This study aimed to investigate whether pre-treatment PA level in HNC predicts aspects of long-term health-related quality of life (HRQL) at 12 months after end of treatment. MethodsThis pilot study included 48 patients diagnosed with HNC, 41 participants remaining at 12 months post-treatment. Pre-treatment PA was objectively assessed by an accelerometer. Self-perceived PA and HRQL were assessed pre-treatment and at 6- and 12-months post-treatment. ResultsPatients with a higher pre-treatment PA level scored higher on physical function and role function and less fatigue and pain at the 12 months follow-up compared to patients with a lower pre-treatment PA. At 6 months the groups differed only on physical functioning. When comparing changes over time, there were statistically significant differences comparing high and low pre-treatment PA in the fatigue and pain domains between 6 and 12 months. Exploratory multiple regression analyses also indicated that higher pre-treatment PA levels were associated with greater favorable change in the four HRQL measures. ConclusionsHigher levels of PA assessed with accelerometer before oncologic treatment associated favorably with aspects of self-perceived HRQL and PA over time in patients with HNC.",0
Label-Less Learning for Urban Railway Transit Driver Fatigue Detection with Heart Rate Variability,"Driver fatigue has a direct impact on urban railway transit (URT) drivers' driving behavior and can cause driver error. The existing methods for fatigue detection mainly train the models with supervised learning, relying heavily on the annotation of recorded data. However, labeled data are unobtainable in some environments, especially for URT driver fatigue levels during actual driving. Therefore, this study proposes a fatigue detection method using unlabeled heart rate variability data to monitor URT driver fatigue in actual working conditions. By utilizing the existing conclusions with regard to factors contributing to fatigue and physiological changes, this study annotated a small number of samples and then used a novel positive and unlabeled learning algorithm based on nearest neighbors and random forest to divide samples into different fatigue levels. The proposed method was evaluated using the URT driver fatigue data sets collected in the lab. Binary classification achieved an accuracy of 79.0%. However, the accuracy of three-class classification was only 55.7%. In addition, the proposed method performed as well using the field data set as it did using the lab data set. The results show the high generalization performance of the proposed method, which could contribute to addressing the issue of lack of labeled training data for fatigue detection in actual working conditions.",1
The Influence of Adaptogens on Ultraweak Biophoton Emission: a Pilot-Experiment,"In the present study, the effect of plant adaptogens; (Rhodiola rosea and ADAPT-232) on human photon emission has been determined. In a randomized double blind placebo-con I rolled study, 30 subjects were randomly assigned to three groups: one group (n = 10) taking placebo pills, one group (n = 10) taking Rhodiola rosea (SHR-5) pills and one group (n = 10) taking ADAPT-232 supplements (the latter being a fixed combination of the following three adaptogens: Eleutherococcus senticosus, Rhodiola rosea and Schisandra chinensis). All subjects underwent measurements to determine ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) of the dorsal side of their hands using a photon-counting device, both before and after a week of taking the supplements. In addition, the experienced levels of stress and fatigue (tiredness) were evaluated. After 1 week of supplementation, the Rhodiola group showed a significant decrease (p = 0.027) in photon emission in comparison with the placebo group. Furthermore, after supplementation, a significant decrease (p = 0.049) concerning the experienced level of fatigue in the Rhodiola group was observed compared with the placebo group. No significant changes were observed between the ADAPT-232 and the placebo group. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0
Individual-based measurements of light intensity provide new insights into the effects of artificial light at night on daily rhythms of urban-dwelling songbirds,"The growing interest in the effects of light pollution on daily and seasonal cycles of animals has led to a boost of research in recent years. In birds, it has been hypothesized that artificial light at night can affect daily aspects of behaviour, but one caveat is the lack of knowledge about the light intensity that wild animals, such as birds, are exposed to during the night.Organisms have naturally evolved daily rhythms to adapt to the 24-h cycle of day and night, thus, it is important to investigate the potential shifts in daily cycles due to global anthropogenic processes such as urbanization.We captured adult male European blackbirds (Turdus merula) in one rural forest and two urban sites differing in the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. We tagged these birds with light loggers and simultaneously recorded changes in activity status (active/non-active) through an automated telemetry system. We first analysed the relationship between light at night, weather conditions and date with daily activity onset and end. We then compared activity, light at night exposure and noise levels between weekdays and weekends.Onset of daily activity was significantly advanced in both urban sites compared to the rural population, while end of daily activity did not vary either among sites. Birds exposed to higher amounts of light in the late night showed earlier onset of activity in the morning, but light at night did not influence end of daily activity. Light exposure at night and onset/end of daily activity timing was not different between weekdays and weekends, but all noise variables were. A strong seasonal effect was detected in both urban and rural populations, such as birds tended to be active earlier in the morning and later in the evening (relative to civil twilight) in the early breeding season than at later stages.Our results point at artificial light at night as a major driver of change in timing of daily activity. Future research should focus on the costs and benefits of altered daily rhythmicity in birds thriving in urban areas.",0
The Choice Point Model of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy With Inpatient Substance Use and Co-occurring Populations: A Pilot Study,"Objectives: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an empirically supported treatment which aims to enhance self-acceptance and a commitment to core values. The present study examined the effectiveness of the Choice Point model of ACT in a residential substance use disorder (SUD) setting. Choice Point is a contemporary approach to ACT and targets transdiagnostic processes.Methods: This uncontrolled quasi-experimental design assessed 47 participants taking part in Choice Point for Substances (CHOPS) in order to investigate its influence on psychological inflexibility, values-based action, and self-compassion over time. The study additionally assessed for sleeper effects and associations between transdiagnostic processes and warning signs of relapse.Results: Findings demonstrated a decrease in psychological inflexibility and increases in values-based action and self-compassion over time. Gains were maintained at follow-up, and sleeper effects were observed for psychological inflexibility and mindfulness. Correlational analysis suggested that all transdiagnostic processes were related to warning signs of relapse at follow-up.Conclusion: These results provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of CHOPS for SUD. Observed sleeper effects in psychological inflexibility and mindfulness indicate that CHOPS may provide longer-term benefits critical to a population where relapse is common. While encouraging, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Future research should utilize comparison groups when investigating CHOPS.",0
Expiratory Pause Maneuver to Assess Inspiratory Muscle Pressure During Assisted Mechanical Ventilation: A Bench Study,"BACKGROUND: The generation of excessive inspiratory muscle pressure (P-mus) during assisted mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure may result in acute respiratory muscle injury and/or fatigue, and exacerbate ventilator-induced lung injury. A readily available noninvasive surrogate measure of P-mus may help in titrating both mechanical ventilation and sedation to minimize these risks. This bench study explored the feasibility and accuracy of using a ventilator's expiratory pause hold function to measure P-mus across multiple operators. METHODS: A standardized technique for executing a brief (<1 s) expiratory pause maneuver was used to measure the airway occlusion pressure change (Delta P-aw) by using 3 simulated P-mus (Delta P-mus: 5, 10, 15 cm H2O) under (1) pressure support ventilation (0, 10, 15 cm H2O), (2) volume and pressure-regulated volume ventilation, (3) flow and pressure-triggering, and (4) varying levels of PEEP and pressure-rise time. Individual and grouped measurements were made by 4-7 clinicians on 3 different ventilators. The concordance between occlusion Delta P-aw and Delta P-mus was arbitrarily set at <= 2 cm H2O. Data were evaluated by using analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer posttest. Correlation was assessed by using the Pearson R test; bias and precision were assessed by using the Bland-Altman method. Alpha was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Grouped expiratory pause maneuver measurements of occlusion Delta P-aw across simulated Delta P-mus, mode and level of ventilatory support showed reasonable concordance, regardless of the ventilator used. Occlusion Delta P-aw accuracy frequently decreased by similar to 3 cm H2O when both pressure support ventilation and Delta P-mus reached 15 cm H2O. Expiratory pause maneuver accuracy was not affected by trigger mechanism and/or sensitivity, PEEP, or the post-trigger pressurization rate. In general, only small differences in Delta P-aw occurred among the individual operators. CONCLUSIONS: The expiratory pause maneuver generally provided reproducible, stable approximations of Delta P-mus across ventilators and ventilator settings, and a range of simulated effort. Technique standardization produced relatively consistent results across multiple operators. The expiratory pause maneuver seemed feasible for general use in monitoring inspiratory effort during assisted mechanical ventilation.",0
Patient-Generated Actigraphy Data as a Novel Outcomes Instrument in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"Background Currently, we lack objective measures to quantify outcomes in carpal tunnel syndrome. Instead, surgeons rely on patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) to assess the effect of carpal tunnel release (CTR). We assessed the validity and reliability of wearable activity monitors to objectively characterize the functional and sleep impact of CTR. We hypothesized that actigraphy could detect changes in sleep and activity and would demonstrate short-term impairment due the operative procedure. Methods This pilot, prospective, cohort study compared validated PROMS with actigraphy data obtained via wearable activity monitors (ActiGraph Link; ActiGraph Corp, Pensacola, Fla). Subjects completed baseline questionnaires and wore their device for 1 week preoperatively as a baseline. Subjects then underwent open CTR, wearing actigraphy devices for 4 weeks and completing questionnaires at 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively. Preintervention and postintervention data were compared using paired-samplettest. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaire data were analyzed in accordance with published PROMIS scoring manuals and raw scores were converted to standardizedTscores. Results Twenty subjects (5 males, 15 females) with moderate or severe carpal tunnel syndrome were enrolled. The mean age was 57.7 years. The PROMIS 29 average cumulativeTscore was 42.9 with average change of -0.072 preoperatively versus postoperatively. Average sleep disturbanceTscore was 38.9 preoperatively and 41.4 postoperatively. There was no statistically significant difference inTscore in any domain. The mean actigraphy activity data demonstrated near immediate return to baseline activity. Actigraphy sleep data demonstrate improvement in sleep fragmentation and decreased duration of awakenings. Conclusions Overall, patient-generated data detected differences in sleep and activity preoperatively versus postoperatively and demonstrated only a short period of activity disruption after CTR, which may be used when counseling patients. These data support actigraphy as a viable adjunct to traditional PROMS to evaluate the impact of surgical intervention and therefore may be useful in the study of other diseases affecting the upper extremity.",0
Disentangling the association between PTSD symptom heterogeneity and alcohol use disorder: Results from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study,"Veterans are at increased risk of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) relative to civilians. Few studies have explored the association between distinct PTSD symptoms and AUD in veterans, and existing findings are highly discrepant. This study aimed to address this gap and equivocal association by evaluating which PTSD symptom clusters are most associated with AUD in a veteran sample using the 7-factor 'hybrid' model of PTSD. Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS), a nationally representative survey of 4069 U.S. veterans. Veterans completed selfreport measures to assess current PTSD symptoms and AUD. Multivariable logistic regression and relative importance analyses were conducted to examine associations between the 7-factor model of PTSD symptoms and AUD. Adjusting for sociodemographic, military, trauma factors, and depressive symptoms, scores on the dysphoric arousal (20.7% relative variance explained [RVE]) and externalizing behaviors (19.0% RVE) symptom clusters were most strongly associated with AUD in the full sample, while externalizing behaviors (47.7% RVE), anxious arousal (23.9% RVE), and dysphoric arousal (12.4%) accounted for the majority of explained variance in veterans who screened positive for PTSD. Results of this nationally representative study of U.S. veterans highlight the importance of externalizing behaviors and arousal symptoms of PTSD as potential drivers of AUD in this population. The 7-factor hybrid model of PTSD provides a more nuanced understanding of PTSD-AUD associations, and may help inform risk assessment and more personalized treatment approaches for veterans with and at-risk for AUD.",0
A systematic review on the potency of swarm intelligent nanorobots in the medical field,"The field of robotics is emerging quickly, and the miniaturization of robots to the nanoscale has opened up new possibilities for healthcare.

A comparison of different ways to approximate time-to-line crossing (TLC) during car driving,"Three experiments are presented: in which the accuracy of different methods to approximate time-to-line crossing is assessed. In the first experiment TLC was computed, using a trigonometric method, during normal driving while the vehicle stayed in lane. The minima of TLC were compared with two approximations and it was found computing TLC as lateral distance divided by lateral velocity gave poor results. It was concluded that this simple approximation is not suitable for measuring TLC minima in studies of driver behaviour. A way of computing TLC that takes account of the curved path of the vehicle resulted in a good fit of TLC minima. In two other experiments the vehicle exceeded the lane boundary, either intentionally as a result of a lane change manoeuvre, or unintentionally as a result of impaired driving. In these cases no TLC minima exists since these only occur as a result of correcting steering actions to stay within the lane. In contrast to normal lane keeping, it was found that prior to crossing the lane boundary, the simple approximation resulted in more accurate estimation of available time before the lane boundary is exceeded compared to the more complex approximation. This indicates that for lane keeping support systems and systems that detect when the driver has fallen asleep and drifts out of lane, a simple algorithm for TLC estimation may give reliable results, while this algorithm is not accurate enough for more fundamental studies of driver behaviour. However, the reliability of the approximation is only satisfactory over a very short time range before the lane boundary is actual exceeded. This may result in warnings that come too late and result in too little time to respond for the driver. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Pilot, randomized trial of resistance exercise during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer","BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of a randomized trial of resistance exercise in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation.MethodsFifteen patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation were randomized to resistance exercise (using resistance bands) or control group. Resistance exercise occurred at the radiation therapy site (weeks 1-6) and home (weeks 7-12).ResultsNo serious adverse events occurred related to resistance exercise. Medium to large effect size differences favoring resistance exercise versus control group were noted for perceived fatigue at 6 weeks (smaller increase in fatigue for resistance exercise group; 7.4 vs 15.4, effect size [d] = -0.64), quality of life at 6 weeks (-7.0 vs -14.4, d = 0.52), and chair rise time (seconds) at 6 and 12 weeks (-1.6 vs 0.4, d = -.63 and -1.9 vs 0.1, d = -0.60, respectively).ConclusionsResistance exercise is safe and feasible in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation; a definitive trial is warranted.

Sleep Problems and Psychosocial Work Environment Among Swedish Commercial Pilots,"Background The aim of this study was to assess relationships between sleeping problems and the psychosocial work situation based on the job-strain and iso-strain models among Swedish commercial pilots.Methods Three hundred fifty-four pilots participated (61%), who are in 2008 responded to a questionnaire concerning sleep problems, the psychosocial work situation, personal factors, and flight length.Results Low social support was associated with sleep problems for pilots. High demands were associated with sleep problems among captains and long-haul flights were associated with sleep problems among first officers. Low skill discretion was associated with less sleep problems among first officers.Conclusions Psychosocial climate at work such as low social support affects negatively sleep for both captains and for first officers. More research on what creates a best social support for pilots and cabin crew is needed. Adjusting scheduling work crew teams could increase social support at work and contribute to a better sleep quality. Am. J. Ind. Med. 54:545-551, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",0
A brief report: Lessons learned using wearable technology to collect data from adults receiving medications for opioid use disorder,"BackgroundIncorporating wearable technology into substance use disorder research enables continuous, objective, and remote data collection, facilitating symptom monitoring to prevent relapse. However, implementation challenges may hinder data collection. This paper aims to assess adherence patterns to a wrist-worn wearable device, and to share lessons learned from incorporating wearable technology to collect physiological data from adults with opioid use disorder.MethodsEmploying a prospective observational design, we used convenience sampling to recruit adults receiving medications for opioid use disorder in outpatient settings. Wearable adherence was measured by days and nights worn over eight weeks, acceptability by a visual analog scale, and anecdotal notes tracked study activities and challenges.ResultsTwenty-three participants completed baseline, and 16 (70.0%) completed the study. Daytime and nighttime wearable adherence averaged 60.1% and 47.7%, respectively. Wearable adherence was highest at the earlier phase of the study (67.7%) and plateaued after overtime. User-related and technical challenges included digital illiteracy, protocol nonadherence, low motivation, measurement errors, and short battery life. Unique challenges included wearable design concerns and sleep problems.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the feasibility of wearable use and highlights the potential to overcome challenges. Proactively sharing insights can facilitate wearable technology adoption for both participants and researchers.",0
A PILOT STUDY TO EVALUATE POSTTREATMENT CEPHALOMETRIC CHANGES IN SUBJECTS WITH OSA,"Statement of problem. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a life-threatening condition that is diagnosed and evaluated primarily by polysomnography (PSG) The procedure is time consuming, expensive, and inconvenient for the patient, and may not be universally available.Purpose. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate posttreatment results on lateral cephalograms in patients with OSAMaterial and methods. Lateral cephalograms of 16 patients diagnosed with OSA were made at the beginning of treatment and 4-6 weeks following treatment. Treatment modalities used in the study were the mandibular advancement device (MAD) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy (n=8). Pharyngeal dimensions, soft palate area and angle, and hyoid bone position were recorded for the comparisons The data were analyzed using Student's t test for the parametric analysis (alpha=05)Results. A significant increase in the pharyngeal area (P<.001), a significant decrease in the soft palate area (P<001), and vertical changes in the hyoid position were observed, with no significant change in the anteroposterior position of the hyoid boneConclusions. Within the limitations of this pilot study, lateral cephalograms were shown to be useful in evaluating treatment efficacy in subjects with OSA (J Prosthet Dent 2010, 103.170-177)",0
Mobile app for personalized sleep-wake management for shift workers: A user testing trial,"ObjectiveDevelopment of personalized sleep-wake management tools is critical to improving sleep and functional outcomes for shift workers. The objective of the current study was to test the performance, engagement and usability of a mobile app (SleepSync) for personalized sleep-wake management in shift workers that aid behavioural change and provide practical advice by providing personalized sleep scheduling recommendations and education. MethodsShift workers (n = 27; 20 healthcare and 7 from other industries) trialled the mobile app for two weeks to determine performance, engagement and usability. Primary outcomes were self-reported total sleep time, ability to fall asleep, sleep quality and perception of overall recovery on days off. Secondary performance outcomes included sleep disturbances (insomnia and sleep hygiene symptoms, and sleep-related impairments) and mood (anxiety, stress and depression) pre- and post-app use. Satisfaction with schedule management, integration into daily routine and influence on behaviour were used to determine engagement, while the usability was assessed for functionality and ease of use of features. ResultsTotal sleep time (P = .04), ability to fall asleep (P < .001), quality of sleep (P = .001), insomnia (P = .02), sleep hygiene (P = .01), sleep-related impairments (P = .001), anxiety (P = .001), and stress (P = .006) were all improved, with non-significant improvements in recovery on days off (P = .19) and depression (P = .07). All measures of engagement and usability were scored positively by the majority of users. ConclusionsThis pilot trial provides preliminary evidence of the positive impact of the SleepSync app in improving sleep and mood outcomes in shift workers, and warrants confirmation in a larger controlled trial.",0
Automated sizing and classification of defects in CANDU pressure tubes,"Pressure tubes within CANDU reactors are subject to frequent ultrasonic non-destructive examination to identify and characterize any defects that pose a risk of initiating Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC), a well-known problem that occurs in zirconium components that are subject to high mechanical and thermal stresses. The analysis of the ultrasonic data gathered from the pressure tubes is often a long and repetitive process on the critical path to the restart of the reactor. Motivations for developing an automated system include saving time on the critical path, minimising human subjectivity from the process and increasing repeatability of measurements. An automated system providing decision support to analysts also reduces the risk of operator fatigue by minimising time spent processing routine defects. This paper describes a novel system for the automated analysis of CANDU pressure tube inspection data. The system automates the entire initial examination process including the complex decision-making procedures by implementing an expert system with an associated rule-base. Results from this system are detailed, illustrating the location and characterisation of defects and key features within the pressure tube with a high degree of accuracy while increasing repeatability through the removal of subjectivity in measurements.",0
Sleepiness of day workers and watchkeepers on board at high seas: a cross-sectional study,"Objectives To estimate the prevalence of sleepiness on duty among day workers and watchkeepers on board.Design Cross-sectional survey in a maritime field study.Setting 10 shipping companies with container vessels under German management.Participants The whole crew (75 day workers and 123 watchkeepers) during 18 voyages on 18 different container ships.Outcome measures Sleepiness on duty and efficiency of sleep using pupillometry (in a cross-shift design) and the SenseWear armband activity monitor.Results The watchkeepers showed significantly shorter sleep periods than day workers (5.5 hours vs 5.8 hours). The average efficiency of sleep was 69.6% and significantly lower among watchkeepers (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.88). 396 pupillometric examinations were carried out and revealed 88 study members (22.2%) with a pupillary unrest index (rPUI) in a range characterised as 'unfit for duty' and 110 seafarers (27.8%) categorised as 'particular attention required'. The average rPUI was similar between day workers and watchkeepers. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale revealed recent daytime sleepiness in 70 seafarers, which was similarly often stated by day workers and watchkeepers. Based on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), a measurable cross-shift increase in the SSS value during the examined shift was observed, especially among watchkeepers. The amount of time already spent on the vessel at the time of the present examination was significantly associated with the rPUI (p=0.009).Conclusion Sleep periods of both the day workers and the watchkeepers aboard vessels were alarmingly short and sleep efficiency was low. Sleepiness on duty is similarly prevalent among day workers and watchkeepers and seems to depend partly on the cumulative working period on the vessels. Preventive measures need to be taken by the shipping industry to counteract fatigue (eg, by enabling sufficient rest and sleep times).",0
Automated classification system for drowsiness detection using convolutional neural network and electroencephalogram,"Detecting drowsiness in drivers while driving is extremely important to avoid possible accidents and reduce the fatality rate due to drivers sleeping at the wheel. A real-time alert generation when the driver might possibly go into sleepy state is essential to safeguard any unwarranted incidents. Wearable sensors to monitor vehicle movement and camera-based systems to monitor driver behaviour are commonly used to detect driver drowsiness. Due to the fact that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have the ability to monitor the mood of humans and are easily obtainable, many different EEG-based drowsiness detection systems have been proposed to date. In this study, a novel deep learning architecture based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for automated drowsiness detection using a single-channel EEG signal. To improve the generalization performance of the proposed method, subject-wise, cross-subject-wise, and combined-subjects-wise validations have been employed. The whole of the work is carried over pre-recorded sleep state EEG data obtained from benchmarked dataset. The experimental results show a superior detection capability compared to the existing state-of-the-art drowsiness detection methods using single-channel EEG signals.",1
Mental Fatigue After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Prospective 5-Year Follow-Up Study,"Objectives: Mental fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom following an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, its long-term prevalence and consequences remain unclear. In this longitudinal pilot study, the Mental Fatigue Scale (MFS) was used to evaluate the prevalence, severity, and dynamics of mental fatigue for up to 5 years and to correlate patient demographics and early complications to the development of mental fatigue.Method: Functional outcomes were scored using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) during telephone interviews 1, 3, and 5 years after aSAH. The MFS questionnaires (maximum score 42, >= 10.5 points indicating mental fatigue) were subsequently sent by mail. Patient admission data and events during the acute phase were recorded.Results: Of 64 included patients, 31 could be assessed at all time points. Mental fatigue (MFS score >= 10.5) was present in 58%, 48%, and 52% of the patients at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. A significant decrease in the total MFS score was observed between 1 and 5 years (p = 0.025). The proportion of patients experiencing severe mental fatigue halved from 1 to 3 years. The median (range) MFS scores were significantly higher for women (14.5, 0-29.5) than for men (3, 0-17.5) at 1 year (p = 0.043). Compared with patients experiencing loss of consciousness at ictus (LOCi), those without LOCi exhibited a progressive decline in the total MFS score (p = 0.003).Conclusions: Although total MFS scores significantly improved, mental fatigue was a common and persistent symptom affecting half of the patients up to 5 years following aSAH. Mental fatigue was more prevalent in women than men; further, patients who experienced LOCi during the acute phase improved less over time. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating mental fatigue when assessing patient recovery and long-term outcomes.Trial Registration: Clinical Trial NCT06239142",0

"Mindfulness-based stress reduction to improve depression, pain and high patient global assessment in controlled rheumatoid arthritis.","Objective: The aim was to improve distressing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) that persisted in RA patients with clinically controlled inflammation (controlled RA).Methods: In a pragmatic pilot study, we offered mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a group intervention, to controlled RA patients who had high (≥16) Centre for Evaluation Studies depression (CES-D) scores and/or patient general assessment of disease activity (PGA) at least 2/10 larger than evaluator general assessment (EGA) (PGA-EGA: Delta). Evaluations before, 6 and 12months after MBSR included CES-D, PGA, modified HAQ, simple disease activity index (SDAI), anxiety (general anxiety disorder 7; GAD-7), coping strategies (coping with health injuries and problems; CHIP), sleep disturbance and pain. Facilitators and obstacles to recruitment and participation were identified. A subset of patients was interviewed for qualitative analysis of their experience.Results: Out of 306 screened patients, 65 were referred, 39 (60%) agreed and 28 (43%) completed MBSR. Anticipated burden, timing and frequency of group meetings, commuting issues, age extremes and co-morbidities were barriers to participation. Up to 12months after MBSR, anxiety, depression, emotion-oriented coping, sleep and function significantly improved. Nonetheless, no significant impact was observed on pain, PGA, Delta or SDAI. The interviews revealed that benefits, including integration of effective coping strategies, were maintained.Conclusion: We addressed MBSR feasibility issues and selection of outcomes in controlled RA patients with distressing PROs. For patients who chose to participate in MBSR, lasting benefits were evident for anxiety, depression, sleep and function. Larger studies are required to evaluate the weaker impact of MBSR on RA-related pain and PGA.",0
Ultra-Long-Term-EEG Monitoring (ULTEEM) Systems: Towards User-Friendly Out-of-Hospital Recordings of Electrical Brain Signals in Epilepsy,"Epilepsy is characterized by the occurrence of epileptic events, ranging from brief bursts of interictal epileptiform brain activity to their most dramatic manifestation as clinically overt bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Epileptic events are often modulated in a patient-specific way, for example by sleep. But they also reveal temporal patterns not only on ultra- and circadian, but also on multidien scales. Thus, to accurately track the dynamics of epilepsy and to thereby enable and improve personalized diagnostics and therapies, user-friendly systems for long-term out-of-hospital recordings of electrical brain signals are needed. Here, we present two wearable devices, namely ULTEEM and ULTEEMNite, to address this unmet need. We demonstrate how the usability concerns of the patients and the signal quality requirements of the clinicians have been incorporated in the design. Upon testbench verification of the devices, ULTEEM was successfully benchmarked against a reference EEG device in a pilot clinical study. ULTEEMNite was shown to record typical macro- and micro-sleep EEG characteristics in a proof-of-concept study. We conclude by discussing how these devices can be further improved and become particularly useful for a better understanding of the relationships between sleep, epilepsy, and neurodegeneration.",0
Wireless Millimeter-Size Soft Climbing Robots With Omnidirectional Steerability on Tissue Surfaces,"Wirelessly actuated miniature soft robots actuated by magnetic fields that can overcome gravity by climbing soft and wet tissues are promising for accessing challenging enclosed and confined spaces with minimal invasion for targeted medical operation. However, existing designs lack the directional steerability to traverse complex terrains and perform agile medical operations. Here we propose a rod-shaped millimeter-size climbing robot that can be omnidirectionally steered with a steering angle up to 360 degrees during climbing beyond existing soft miniature robots. The design innovation includes the rod-shaped robot body, its special magnetization profile, and the spherical robot footpads, allowing directional bending of the body under external magnetic fields and out-of-plane motion of the body for delivery of medical patches. With further integrated bio-adhesives and microstructures on the footpads, we experimentally demonstrated inverted climbing of the robot on porcine gastrointestinal (GI) tract tissues and deployment of a medical patch for targeted drug delivery.",0
Effects of mental workload on physiological and subjective responses during traffic density monitoring: A field study,"This study evaluated operators' mental workload while monitoring traffic density in a city traffic control center. To determine the mental workload, physiological signals (ECG, EMG) were recorded and the NASA-Task Load Index (TLX) was administered for 16 operators. The results showed that the operators experienced a larger mental workload during high traffic density than during low traffic density. The traffic control center stressors caused changes in heart rate variability features and EMG amplitude, although the average workload score was significantly higher in HTD conditions than in LTD conditions. The findings indicated that increasing traffic congestion had a significant effect on HR, RMSSD, SDNN, LF/ HF ratio, and EMG amplitude. The results suggested that when operators' worldoad increases, their mental fatigue and stress level increase and their mental health deteriorate. Therefore, it maybe necessary to implement an ergonomic program to manage mental health. Furthermore, by evaluating mental workload, the traffic control center director can organize the center's traffic congestion operators to sustain the appropriate mental workload and improve traffic control management.

Analysis of performance influence factors on shipboard drills to improve ship emergency preparedness at sea,"Emergency preparedness is a critical aspect of ship management. It is required to establish strict procedures including drill and exercise programs to response emergency situations at any time. This study develops an approach to identify and quantify the influence factors to ship emergency preparedness demonstrated in drills on-board. A fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is considered as a suitable method for the problem. As a case study, the affecting factors to predefined steps of an operational firefighting drill organisation are analysed in oil/product tanker at Sarkoy anchorage area. Five homogeneous experts were asked to evaluate relationship among the generic factors affecting firefighting drills on-board ship with respect to the linguistic scale. While the factors insufficient firefighting practice and training, missing crew and missing supervisor, incorrect placement of portable tools, equipment or material in firefighting system are found as cause factors; lack of safety culture and discipline about the use of personnel protective/firefighting equipment and firefighting, crew reliability and fatigues of crews on board are found as effect factors. The study is expected to contribute to the forthcoming studies on prediction of ship emergency preparedness level on-board ships.",0
Promoting Soldier Cognitive Readiness for Battle Tank Operations Through Bio-signal Measurements,"This paper will present the progress in developing a concept and a demonstrator system for the assessment of fatigue, acute stress and combat/cognitive readiness in military domain. A battle-tank crew's acute stress is measured with electrocardiography recordings of heart rate/heart rate variability. Cognitive performance is measured with a battery of cognitive tests, and task performance is estimated by soldiers' self-ratings, trainers' evaluations and objective measures from simulator data. The project consists of several test sessions in which cognitive and physiological indices of stress are measured while military conscripts perform battle-tank exercises both in simulator and field settings. The effect of task difficulty, sleep deprivation and operator role on performance are investigated. Different versions of the demonstrator system are also evaluated. The project results will be primarily used for the development of a bio-signal monitoring system, evaluation of transfer of simulator training to real-life exercises and improvement of military aptitude testing.",0
Torsional fatigue strength of reciprocating and rotary pathfinding instruments manufactured from different NiTi alloys,"To evaluate the torsional properties of engine-driven pathfinding instruments manufactured from different NiTi alloys R-Pilot (tip size 12.5;.04 taper; M-Wire) and One G (tip size 14;.03 taper; Conventional NiTi). A total of 40 NiTi instruments from engine-driven pathfinding instruments (n = 20) were used. The torsion tests followed ISO 3630-1 (1992). Three millimeters of each instrument tip was fastened to a small load cell by a lever arm linked to the axis of torsion. During the test, the torsion testing machine software measured the maximum torsional strength and angle of rotation (degrees) before instrument failure. The fractured surface of each instrument was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, a supplementary examination was performed to measure the cross-sectional area and the metal mass volume of each instrument 3 mm from the tip. Data were analyzed using a t-test, with significance level set at 5%. R-pilot had significantly higher torsional strength than did One G (p < 0.05). Regarding the angle of rotation to fracture, One G had higher angles than did R-Pilot (p < 0.05). The supplementary examination showed that R-Pilot had the highest cross-sectional area and volume of metal mass at 3 mm from the tip (p < 0.05). R-pilot (M-Wire NiTi alloy) had a significantly higher torsional strength and One-G (superelastic NiTi alloy) had the highest angle of rotation to fracture.",0
Respiration monitoring in PACU using ventilation and gas exchange parameters,"The importance of perioperative respiration monitoring is highlighted by high incidences of postoperative respiratory complications unrelated to the original disease. The objectives of this pilot study were to (1) simultaneously acquire respiration rate (RR), tidal volume (TV), minute ventilation (MV), SpO(2) and PetCO(2) from patients in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and (2) identify a practical continuous respiration monitoring method by analyzing the acquired data in terms of their ability and reliability in assessing a patient's respiratory status. Thirteen non-intubated patients completed this observational study. A portable electrical impedance tomography (EIT) device was used to acquire RREIT, TV and MV, while PetCO(2), RRCap and SpO(2) were measured by a Capnostream35. Hypoventilation and respiratory events, e.g., apnea and hypopnea, could be detected reliably using RREIT, TV and MV. PetCO(2) and SpO(2) provided the gas exchange information, but were unable to detect hypoventilation in a timely fashion. Although SpO(2) was stable, the sidestream capnography using the oronasal cannula was often unstable and produced fluctuating PetCO(2) values. The coefficient of determination (R-2) value between RREIT and RRCap was 0.65 with a percentage error of 52.5%. Based on our results, we identified RR, TV, MV and SpO(2) as a set of respiratory parameters for robust continuous respiration monitoring of non-intubated patients. Such a respiration monitor with both ventilation and gas exchange parameters would be reliable and could be useful not only for respiration monitoring, but in making PACU discharge decisions and adjusting opioid dosage on general hospital floor. Future studies are needed to evaluate the potential clinical utility of such an integrated respiration monitor.",0
Prehabilitative high-intensity interval training and resistance exercise in patients prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation,"Physical capacity prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has been shown as a relevant prognostic factor for survival after transplant. Therefore, we evaluated feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate to high-intensity resistance exercise (RE) to increase physical capacity in patient's prior allo-HCT. In this multicentre single arm pilot study, a supervised exercise program was performed twice weekly for 4-12 weeks prior allo-HCT, depending on the individual time remaining. Outcomes were feasibility (recruitment, adherence, safety), physical capacity (cardiorespiratory fitness [VO2peak], muscle strength) and patient reported outcomes (physical functioning, fatigue). Thirty patients were intended, 16 could be included, and 14 completed post intervention assessment (75% male, 55 +/- 11 years). The study was stopped early due to a low recruitment rate. Nine patients (64%) reached the initial minimum planned number of eight exercise sessions. Individual adherence was high with 92% for HIIT and 85% for RE. 87% of all performed exercise sessions were completed without complaints and VO2peak increased significantly from 20.4 to 23.4 ml/kg/min. The low recruitment rate suggests that initiation of the intervention concept immediately before allo-HCT is feasible only in a small number of patients. In particular, the timeframe directly prior allo-HCT seems too short for exercise interventions, although the exercise program was designed to improve outcomes in a very short time frame. HIIT and RE were feasible, effective and well accepted by the included patients.",0
Low physical activity in patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer,"Background This pilot study aimed to describe physical activity (PA) and self-perceived function, health and quality of life (QoL) prior to oncological treatment in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods In a prospective study including 49 patients, self-perceived PA (Saltin-Grimby scale) and health-related QoL (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire Core 30 and EQ-5D) were assessed. Further, PA was also measured by an accelerometer attached to the thigh for eight consecutive days. The accelerometer PA was compared to the PA of a reference population assessed with the same method. Results presented are from data collected before start of oncological treatment. Results The patients (44-79 years, 65% males) spent most of their time in sedentary behavior: a median of 555 minutes/day in bed (39% of total) and 606 minutes/day sitting (41%). Only 129 minutes/day were spent moving/walking. Patients with higher education, reduced physical function and higher fatigue were less physically active (P <= .01). Further, the different PA measures demonstrated a pattern of being less physically active compared to the reference population. Conclusions Patients diagnosed for HNC may have low PA level. Assessment of PA from accelerometer data may be an important component of oncological treatment to identify patients in need for PA intervention that may enhance treatment outcome.",0
CCGT unit commitment model with first-principle formulation of cycling costs due to fatigue damage,"Combined cycle gas turbine power plants (CCGTs) play a key role in modern electric power systems due to their operational flexibility and the firmness they provide to the networks where they operate. Due in part to this flexibility and firmness, the function of CCGTs has experienced a significant evolution with the advent of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind: CCGTs are increasingly required to rapidly vary load levels in order to counterbalance the fluctuations of renewable energy sources and satisfy overall system demand. The purpose of this paper is to develop a methodology that can be used for assessing the optimal operational strategy of a CCGT when subjected to cycling requirements. This is achieved by introducing a unit commitment formulation that takes into account useful life expenditure costs due to fatigue damage accumulation associated to cycling. The case studies presented in this paper show that neglecting fatigue cycling costs when making operational decisions generates suboptimal cost and profit outcomes for CCGT operators. Furthermore, it is shown that profitability of CCGTs is compromised in systems with very significant penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, due to the increase in cycling costs derived from continuous load-following operation.

Determinants of self-perceived quality of life in mildly disabled multiple sclerosis patients: a cross-sectional study,"Introduction While the determinants influencing self-perceived health-related quality of life (spHRQoL) in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) and severe physical impairment have been well investigated, their impact on pwMS with mild disability is poorly addressed. We aimed to investigate possible drivers of spHRQoL among Sardinian pwMS with an EDSS lower than 2.5. Methods A sample of 87 fully ambulatory (EDSS < 2.5) pwMS were included after screening for major cognitive impairment. spHRQoL was measured with the Italian version of 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) were used as dependent variables for univariate analysis with Cognitive Behavioral Assessment (CBA) and specific individual factors as independent variables. Subsequent multivariate general linear models (GLMs) for PCS and MCS respectively were run after stepwise regression. Normative data referring to Italian population were used for comparison. Results As compared to normative data, no statistically significant difference was found for PCS, while MCS was reduced. Multivariate GLMs showed a significant association between lower PCS scores and presence of psychosomatic symptoms, older age and fatigue (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a significant association was shown between lower MCS scores and presence of anxiety (p < 0.001). Conclusion Mood, presence of psychosomatic symptoms, fatigue and age can have a relevant impact on spHRQoL in people with mildly disabling MS and should be considered in the management of such individuals.",0
A Feasibility Study of Group-Delivered Behavioral Interventions for Insomnia Among Breast Cancer Survivors: Comparing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia and a Mind-Body Intervention,"Objectives: An estimated 30%-50% of breast cancer survivors (BCSs) report persistent insomnia, which may affect daytime functioning and quality of life, and lead to longer term health complications. Although the gold standard insomnia intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), has demonstrated efficacy, accessibility is limited due to a scarcity of trained providers, and adherence to therapy is variable. Group-delivered alternative therapies may offer an opportunity to reach and treat BCSs with insomnia. This pilot study was designed to assess feasibility of a group-delivered mind-body intervention compared with group-delivered CBT-I among BCSs. Design: The authors recruited n = 25 stages I - IV BCSs to a 9-week trial of group therapy for insomnia. Eligible women were assigned to the next upcoming group until it was full. Primary outcomes were to assess intervention feasibility measured by (1) qualitative focus group feedback and (2) attendance. The feasibility of using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was also assessed in this population and ISI change scores were gathered to allow for power calculations in a future trial. Means and frequencies were used to describe participant demographics and attendance. Results: The authors found higher attendance (86% vs. 67% of sessions) and greater satisfaction with the intervention (84.6% vs. 57.1%) reported among mind-body participants than among CBT-I participants. Qualitative feedback suggested more group cohesion among the mind-body group and lower incentive to attend in-person among the CBT-I group. Conclusions: The results suggest that delivering a mind-body intervention for BCSs is feasible and acceptable, based on attendance and qualitative feedback.",0
Towards formal verification of ASIP based on HDPN,"Verification is one of the most complex and expensive tasks in current Application Spec fie Instruction-set I Processor (ASIP) design process. Many existing approaches utilize a multi-level strategy to efficiently design and verify ASIP aiming to discover the flaws earlier This paper presents a verification approach based on HDPN (Hardware Design based-on Petri Net) and NuSMV. The validation of static properties, viz. structural and functional description of ASIP architecture, implements with HDPN, and the verification of dynamic properties, viz. logic design, implements with NuSMV In order to check the dynamic properties of HDPN-based models, a scheme of translating from a HDPN description into SMV is discussed in this paper. In addition, a DLX pipelined processor is presented to demonstrate the verification approach.",0
Sjogrens Systemic Clinical Activity Index (SCAI)a systemic disease activity measure for use in clinical trials in primary Sjgrens syndrome,"Objective. This article describes the development of the Sjgren's Systemic Clinical Activity Index (SCAI) for the measurement of systemic disease activity in patients with primary Sjgrens syndrome (PSS).Methods. A pilot tool was developed based on expert consensus and previous published data. One hundred and four patients with PSS were evaluated in a cross-sectional analysis, of whom 65 were reviewed at 3-monthly intervals, using this index, over a 12-month period. Factor analysis was used to evaluate the proposed domain structure. External validation was assessed by comparison with relevant domains of the Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort (PROFAD), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) and The World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref (WHOQOL-BREF). Sensitivity to change was assessed by comparing SCAI-derived flares with physician-designated disease flare and intention-to-treat analysis. A reliability and repeatability workshop was also held.Results. Factor analysis supported the proposed domain structure. There were strong correlations between the SCAI fatigue, musculoskeletal and Raynauds components and the PROFAD fatigue, arthralgia and vascular domains. There was a significant correlation between change in therapy and SCAI-defined flares (P = 0.01). The mean kappa-test results both for reliability of the SCAI and for physician repeatability were 0.71.Conclusion. This initial evaluation supports the potential for the SCAI as a tool for systemic activity assessment in patients with PSS but additional work is required to assess sensitivity to change in clinical therapeutic trials.",0
"Metabolic, immune and inflammatory responses to a repeated-sprint ability test using FT-IR spectrometry in single blood micro-samples: a pilot study","BACKGROUND: The repeated-sprint ability (RSA) plays a crucial role for determining success in many team sports. Unfortunately, several studies hypothesized that strenuous exercise could cause functional disorders or even some pathologies. These constraints are often associated to different physiological and metabolic disturbances that may reduce the sportive performance or even stop the activity. The purpose of this study was to examine the metabolic, immune and inflammatory responses to a repeated sprint test in trained subjects using a FT-IR spectrometry determination.METHODS: Eleven male football players were required to perform six sprints of six seconds each with 24 seconds of recovery between repetitions. Two blood samples were collected, before and immediately after effort, and 19 parameters related to metabolic, immune and inflammatory responses were assessed by FT-IR spectrometry.RESULTS: This study reported that the total work was positively correlated to the VO2max of subjects (r=0.74; P<0.05) and the lactate concentration (r=0.64; P<0.05). Our results noted also that glucose, lactate, protein, transferrin, Apo-Al, Apo-B, IgG, C-reactive protein, haptoglobin and orosomucoid concentrations increased; however, IgA and IgM concentrations decreased after multiple sprints (P<0.001 for lactate, and P<0.05 for the rest). No significant changes were noted in cholesterol, amino acids and albumin concentrations.CONCLUSIONS: Our data noted that the ability to sprint repeatedly with a short time interval of rest is related to the aerobic system's ability to resynthesize energy, and eliminate lactate during rest periods. Unfortunately, RSA-Test is often associated with different physiological and metabolic disturbances that may lead to a transit immuno-depressive period, and an inflammatory status.",0
"Physical activity, subjective sleep quality and time in bed do not vary by moon phase in German adolescents","Lunar periodicity in human biology and behaviour, particularly sleep, has been reported. However, estimated relationships vary in direction (more or less sleep with full moon) if they exist at all, and studies tend to be so small that there is potential for confounding by weekly or monthly cycles. Lunar variation in physical activity has been posited as a driver of this relationship, but is likewise not well studied. We explore the association between lunar cycle, sleep and physical activity in a population-based sample of 1411 Germans age 14-17years (46% male). Physical activity (daily minutes moderate-to-vigorous activity) was objectively assessed by accelerometry for a total of 8832days between 2011 and 2014. At the same time, time in bed (h) and subjective sleep quality (1-6) were diaried each morning. In models corrected for confounding, we found that lunar phase was not significantly associated with physical activity, subjective sleep quality or time in bed in either sex, regardless of season. Observed relationships varied randomly in direction between models, suggesting artefact. Thus, this large, objectively-measured and well-controlled population of adolescents displayed no lunar periodicity in objective physical activity, subjective sleep quality or time in bed.",0
Design and Implementation of a Driver's Eye State Recognition Algorithm Based on PERCLOS,"In order to improve the general detection accuracy of eye state, this paper puts forward an innovative method for judging human eye state based on PERCLOS. After pretreatment of the eye image, Hough transformation is used for ellipse detection and pupil position. The gray projection variance threshold analysis is then used to help make the final detection. Freeman chain and the Snake model algorithm are used for the corner detection and precise calculation of the height of an open eye. Thus the PERCLOS value and the eye state can be figured out. The performance of our eye state recognition algorithm is validated by more than 1000 images within product database. The statistics result shows that the fatigue detection accuracy rate can meet the need of usage in complex environment.",1
The International development of PROQOL-HCV: An instrument to assess the health-related quality of life of patients treated for Hepatitis C virus,"Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) compromises Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL) with detriments to Physical, Mental and Social health domains. Treatment with interferon and ribavirin is associated with side effects which further impair HRQL. New treatments appear potent, effective and tolerable. However, Patient Reported Outcomes instruments that capture the impact on HRQL for people with hepatitis C are largely non-specific and will be needed in the new treatment era. Therefore, we developed a conceptually valid multidimensional model of HCV-specific quality of life and pilot survey instrument, the Patient Reported Outcome Quality of Life survey for HCV (PROQOL-HCV).Methods: HCV patients from France (n = 30), Brazil (n = 20) and Australia (n = 20) were interviewed to investigate HCV-HRQL issues raised in the scientific literature and by treatment specialists. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and translated into English and French.Results: Fifteen content dimensions were derived from the qualitative analysis, refined and fitted to four domains: (1) Physical Health included: fatigue, pain, sleep, sexual impairment and physical activity; (2) Mental Health: psychological distress, psychosocial impact, and cognition; (3) Social Health: support, stigma, social activity, substance use; (4) Treatment: management, side effects, and fear of treatment failure. The impact of some dimensions extended beyond their primary domain including: physical activity, cognition, sleep, sexual impairment, and the three treatment dimensions. A bank of 300 items was constructed to reflect patient reports and, following expert review, reduced to a 72-item pilot questionnaire.Conclusion: We present a conceptually valid multidimensional model of HCV-specific quality of life and the pilot survey instrument, PROQOL-HCV. The model is widely inclusive of the experience of hepatitis C and the first to include the treatment dimension.",0
Optimized Green Operation of LTE Networks in the Presence of Multiple Electricity Providers,"Energy efficiency aspects in cellular networks can significantly contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and help to save the environment. The base station (BS) sleeping strategy has become a well-known technique to achieve energy savings by switching off redundant BSs mainly for lightly loaded networks. Besides, introducing renewable energies as alternative power sources becomes a real challenge to network operators. In this paper, we propose a method that reduces the energy consumption of BSs by not only shutting down underutilized BSs but also by optimizing the amounts of energy procured from different retailers (Renewable energy and electricity retailers). We formulate an optimization problem that leads to the maximization of the profit of a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) cellular operator, and at the same time to the minimization of CO2 emissions in green wireless cellular networks without affecting the desired Quality of Service.",0
Morning Versus Evening Bright Light Treatment at Home to Improve Function and Pain Sensitivity for Women with Fibromyalgia: A Pilot Study,"Objective. To test the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of a home-based morning versus evening bright light treatment on function and pain sensitivity in women with fibromyalgia.Design. A single blind randomized study with two treatment arms: 6 days of a 1 hour morning light treatment or 6 days of a 1 hour evening light treatment. Function, pain sensitivity, and circadian timing were assessed before and after treatment.Setting. Participants slept at home, except for two nights in Sleep Center.Participants. Ten women meeting the American College of Rheumatology's diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, including normal blood test results.Methods. Self-reported function was assessed with the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). Pain sensitivity was assessed using a heat stimulus that gave measures of threshold and tolerance. Circadian timing was assessed with the dim light melatonin onset.Results. Both morning and evening light treatments led to improvements in function and pain sensitivity. However, only the morning light treatment led to a clinically meaningful improvement in function (>14% reduction from baseline FIQ) and morning light significantly increased pain threshold more than evening light (P < 0.05). Phase advances in circadian timing were associated with an increase in pain tolerance (r = 0.67, P < 0.05).Conclusions. Bright light treatment appears to be a feasible and acceptable adjunctive treatment to women with fibromyalgia. Those who undergo morning light treatment may show improvements in function and pain sensitivity. Advances in circadian timing may be one mechanism by which morning light improves pain sensitivity. Findings can inform the design of a randomized controlled trial.",0
Image Acquisition of Drivers' Fatigue State Based On Fuzzy Evaluation,"The research on monitoring and predicting drivers' fatigue state has remarkable effect on prevention of traffic accidents, using the CCD image sensor camera as the image acquisition device of driver's face and the 940nm infrared emitting diode as the light supplementary device and 3-points light supplementary had been utilized, the light supplementary system had been optimized by the experiment of infrared light supplementary which proceeded by means of combining the orthogonal experiment and expert fuzzy evaluation. The research result makes great sense to the monitoring of drivers' fatigue state and traffic safety",1
Open-Loop Neurofeedback Audiovisual Stimulation: A Pilot Study of Its Potential for Sleep Induction in Older Adults,"This pilot study tested the efficacy of a 30-min audio-visual stimulation (AVS) program for the treatment of chronic insomnia in older adults. Chronic insomnia has been conceptualized as entailing increased cortical high frequency EEG activity at sleep onset and during NREM sleep. We hypothesized that an AVS program gradually descending from 8 to 1 Hz would potentially reduce the excessive cortical activation that is thought to contribute to difficulties with initiating and maintaining sleep. Accordingly, we conducted an intervention study of AVS using a pre-post design. Eight older adults (88 +/- A 8.7 years) complaining of chronic insomnia self-administered a 30-min AVS program nightly at bedtime for one month. Sleep was assessed at baseline and throughout the 4-week intervention. After using AVS for 4 weeks, significant improvement was reported in insomnia symptoms (ISI, p = 0.002) and sleep quality (PSQI, p = 0.004); with moderate to large effect sizes (Partial Eta2: 0.20-0.55)(Cohen's d: 0.7-2.3). The training effect (self-reported sleep improvement) was observed at the end of week one and persisted through the 1-month intervention. The results from this pilot study suggest that further exploration of AVS as a treatment for insomnia is warranted.",0
Vibroacoustic modulation method with arbitrary probe wave frequency based on machine learning algorithms,"The vibro-acoustic modulation (VAM) method assesses the integrity of a structure using modulation of a high-frequency probe wave and a low-frequency pump wave and measuring the modulation index. A large body of studies found that the modulation index could be used for the defection of contact-type defects in different materials. However, it was also found that the performance of this method is dependent on the probe wave frequency selection. To enhance the robustness of this method, researchers made efforts to modify the VAM method raising the complexity of the equipment and related operator skills, creating needs for extra preparation or procedures. All of these limits VAM potential for industrial application. To develop a robust, efficient, and fast VAM-based non-destructive testing method, the machine learning algorithm was employed. The algorithm utilises amplitude of the multiple sidebands of the modulation spectrum as feature variables and the structural integrity as target variables for training and testing the machine learning model. The experimental result shows that the fatigue crack could be detected with an arbitrary probe wave frequency using the applied machine learning approach.",0
Preliminary examination of the efficacy and safety of a standardized chamomile extract for chronic primary insomnia: A randomized placebo-controlled pilot study,"Background: Despite being the most commonly used herbal for sleep disorders, chamomile's (Matricaria recutita) efficacy and safety for treating chronic primary insomnia is unknown. We examined the preliminary efficacy and safety of chamomile for improving subjective sleep and daytime symptoms in patients with chronic insomnia.Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial in 34 patients aged 18-65 years with DSM-IV primary insomnia for >= 6-months. Patients were randomized to 270 mg of chamomile twice daily or placebo for 28-days. The primary outcomes were sleep diary measures. Secondary outcomes included daytime symptoms, safety assessments, and effect size of these measures.Results: There were no significant differences between groups in changes in sleep diary measures, including total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep quality, and number of awakenings. Chamomile did show modest advantage on daytime functioning, although these did not reach statistical significance. Effect sizes were generally small to moderate (Cohen's d <= 0.20 to < 0.60) with sleep latency, night time awakenings, and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), having moderate effect sizes in favor of chamomile. However, TST demonstrated a moderate effect size in favor of placebo. There were no differences in adverse events reported by the chamomile group compared to placebo.Conclusion: Chamomile could provide modest benefits of daytime functioning and mixed benefits on sleep diary measures relative to placebo in adults with chronic primary insomnia. However, further studies in select insomnia patients would be needed to investigate these conclusions.",0
Standardizing and personalizing the treat to target (T2T) approach for rheumatoid arthritis using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS): baseline findings on patient-centered treatment priorities,"A treat to target (T2T) approach to management has become the standard of care for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While consensus T2T recommendations call for patient involvement in the treatment process, the targets commonly used to drive therapeutic decisions involve limited patient input. A pilot study was developed to explore whether the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) could add value to the T2T approach by providing a way to bring patient goals into the process. We report here the baseline data from this study. RA patients from an academic rheumatology practice were recruited to participate in this 1-year study. Patients were asked to complete PROMIS computer-assisted testing at quarterly visits during the year. At baseline, they were asked to identify the PROMIS domain (Pain Interference, Fatigue, Depression, Physical Function, and Social Function) that felt most important to their quality of life. They were then asked to select five representative items from this domain, to be followed through the year. Complete baseline data was available for 119 patients. Most selected Physical Function (39%) or Pain Interference (37%) as their highest priority PROMIS domain. Sixty percent ranked Depression as their lowest priority domain. Younger patients more frequently prioritized Social Function, while older patients more frequently prioritized Fatigue. The incorporation of PROMIS questionnaires into routine clinic visits is a feasible mechanism for incorporating patient preferences into a T2T approach to managing RA.",0
Pilot Study of an Internet-Based Self-Management Program for Symptom Control in Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Many survivors of breast cancer experience an array of chronic symptoms, including pain, insomnia, and fatigue. Few effective therapies have been identified. Behavioral management programs to address similar symptom clusters in other chronic conditions have been effective. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of an Internet-based lifestyle and behavioral self-management program on cancer-related symptoms.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with stage 0 to 3 breast cancer who reported insomnia, pain, or fatigue as their primary symptom of concern during the 7 days before enrollment were enrolled. Local therapies and/or chemotherapy were completed at least 3 months before enrollment. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks, and they completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Profile and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaire electronically. Change in each of the eight symptom domains was assessed.RESULTS: Fifty patients enrolled. In the 45 patients with both baseline and 8-week PROMIS data, statistically significant improvements in anxiety, sleep, fatigue, activity level, and pain severity were reported. Of the 35 patients who responded to the PGIC, 62.9% reported improvement in their primary symptom. Those who reported fatigue as their primary symptom reported greatest overall benefit in multiple symptom improvement, including improvements in fatigue, anxiety, pain severity, pain interference, and participation in social activities.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that this lifestyle and behavioral management program may improve multiple symptoms in breast cancer survivors when delivered via the Internet. Randomized studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of the online intervention compared with standard symptom management approaches and to identify patients most likely to benefit.",0
Nanohybrid and microfilled hybrid versus conventional hybrid composite restorations: 5-year clinical wear performance,"The 5-year findings of a randomized clinical trial testing the null hypothesis that there are no differences between the clinical-wear performances of nano-, microfilled-, and conventional hybrids placed in class I and class II cavities are reported. Effects of subject-, operator-, and restoration-related variables on wear were assessed. Sixteen Tetric-C, 17 Tetric-EC, and 16 Gradia-DP restorations were placed in human molars and recalled at baseline, 6 months and at yearly intervals. The gypsum replicas at each recall were scanned (3D laser scanning), epoxy resin replicas were observed under scanning electron microscope and linear mixed models were used to study the influence of different variables on wear. The generalized vertical wear rate/month were (1.4 mu m Tetric-C and Tetric-EC; 1.8 mu m Gradia-DP) and volume wear rate/month were (0.017 mm(3) Tetric-EC; 0.018 mm(3) Gradia-DP, and 0.011 mm(3) Tetric-EC). Operator-cavity type interaction and surface area of restorations did significantly influence the volume wear rates (p < 0.05). The three wear patterns: fatigue cracks at heavy occlusal contact area/OCA, pitting at light OCA, and scratches/striations along the food escape pathways were evident. The three hybrids differed significantly in volume wear due to material and operator variables. Clinical relevance: Clinically, operators and cavity type can affect restorations' wear magnitude but do not contribute to increased functional risk of fracture or harmful effect on pulp and periodontal biocompatibility.",0
Recreational possibilities for seafarers during shipboard leisure time,"Purpose: This study is aiming to document the leisure time opportunities and their actual utilization on board merchant ships. Methods: A scientist examined the whole crew on board 22 container ships (323 seafarers; participation rate 88.5%). Data about energy consumption and heart rate were continuously collected during the seafarers' leisure and sleeping time through a SenseWear (R) wrist monitor and a Polar watch RS 800 worn for at least 2.5 days. Results: The seafarers spent an average of 28.2% of the day for leisure time activities and 32.6% for sleeping. A significantly higher energy consumption was found among deck ratings compared to engine room personnel and nautical officers. Across all occupational groups, the variability of the heart rate was lower during sleeping hours than during leisure time. Suggestions for substantial improvement of the leisure time opportunities on board included more frequent and free opportunities for telecommunication (59.1%), shorter work assignments, and a stronger cohesion of the crew. The following coping strategies were paramount: calming down/settling down (41.9%), getting in touch with the family (32.0%) and relaxing/sleeping (30.4%). Conclusions The limited heart rate variability during sleeping hours suggests a reduced quality of sleep that might be due to the permanent heaving motions of the vessel, noise, and vibration. The (deck) ratings had more physical activities that corresponded with their higher energy consumption during leisure time. Altogether, there is a need to optimize opportunities for relaxation and recreation on board, taking into consideration characteristics of the different occupational and ethnic groups.",0
Evening cortisol levels are prognostic for progression-free survival in a prospective pilot study of head and neck cancer patients,"Introduction Cortisol rhythm disruptions predict early mortality in renal, colorectal, lung, and metastatic breast cancer. In head and neck cancer (HNC), various cortisol indices are known to correlate with adverse psychological and biological (e.g., inflammatory) outcomes, but links to mortality have yet to be demonstrated. We hypothesize that the prognostic value of diurnal cortisol aberrations will hold in HNC. Prior work leads us to predict that flattened or elevated diurnal cortisol profiles will be associated with elevations of serum inflammatory and tumor-promoting cytokines in this population, and that these immune markers would themselves predict poor progression-free survival.Method We prospectively recruited a pilot sample of HNC patients (N=40) at a multidisciplinary HNC clinic. Most patients presented with late-stage oral/oropharyngeal cancer, were older than 50, male, and subsequently received combined-modality (surgery and/or radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy) treatment with curative intent. Saliva was collected twice daily for six days to assess diurnal slope, mean, waking, and evening cortisol levels. Serum was assayed for an exploratory panel of inflammatory and tumor-promoting cytokines. Two years post study-entry, disease progression and survivorship status were abstracted from medical records. Bivariate correlations, linear regressions, and Cox Proportional Hazards models tested hypotheses.Results Elevations of evening cortisol and diurnal mean levels were each associated with shorter progression-free survival (evening: Hazard Ratio [HR]=1.848, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=1.057-3.230, p=.031; diurnal mean: HR=2.662, 95% CI=1.115-6.355, p=.027). Bivariate correlations revealed that higher levels of the serum inflammatory marker interferon (IFN)-gamma were linked with elevated evening (r=.405, p=.014) and mean (r=.459, p=.004) cortisol. Higher expression of IFN-gamma also predicted poorer progression-free survival (HR=4.671, 95% CI=1.409-15.484, p=.012).Discussion Elevated evening and diurnal mean cortisol were both prognostic; suggesting cortisol secretion is both dysregulated and elevated among patients who subsequently experienced accelerated disease progression. These exploratory data from 40 HNC patients mirror relationships between cortisol and survival identified among patients with numerous other tumor types. This pilot study highlights the need for research on effects of cortisol rhythm disruption among HNC patients. Future research in larger samples should also examine the role of inflammatory and tumor-promoting factors-both systemically and within the tumor microenvironment-as potential mediators of cortisol rhythm disruption.",0
Sleep in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) before and after 6-month treatment with methylphenidate: a pilot study,"Children with ADHD may present with sleep disturbances that add to the impairment of the disorder. The long-term sleep effects of the first-line pharmacological treatment for ADHD, i.e., psychostimulants, are unclear. In this pilot study, we compared polysomnographic variables in children with ADHD (n = 11, aged 6-15 years), before pharmacological treatment, and in children without ADHD (n = 22, aged 5-14 years); we also assessed polysomnographic changes in children with ADHD (n = 7) after a 6-month treatment with methylphenidate immediate-release (once or twice daily). Compared to children without ADHD, those with ADHD at baseline presented with significantly increased duration of awakenings (p = 0.02), reduction in sleep efficiency (p = 0.03), and increase in stage I (N1) (p < 0.01) and reduction in stage II (N2) (p = 0.02) and stage III-IV (N3) percentages. Methylphenidate treatment did not significantly change any parameter of sleep architecture.Conclusion: Preliminary evidence from this pilot study shows that, compared to children without ADHD, those with ADHD presented a more fragmented and less effective sleep at baseline and that the 6-month methylphenidate treatment did not further negatively impact on sleep architecture.",0
Escalating Doses of Transdermal Nicotine in Heavy Smokers Effects on Smoking Behavior and Craving,"Fixed-dose nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is efficacious for smoking cessation in the general population of smokers. However, it is less effective in populations with psychiatric comorbidities and/or severe tobacco dependence where the percent nicotine replacement is suboptimal. The objective of this pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of nicotine patch dose titration in response to continued smoking in heavily dependent smokers with psychiatric comorbidity. In a single-arm, open-label study adult smokers (mean cigarettes per day, 25.4 +/- 13.4; range, 14-43; n = 12) willing to quit were treated with escalating doses of transdermal nicotine and brief counseling intervention if they continued to smoke over a 9-week treatment period. Plasma nicotine and cotinine, along with expired carbon monoxide levels, and the subjective effects of smoking, urge to smoke, demand elasticity, and mood symptoms were also assessed. The mean NRT dose was 32.7 (SD, 16.4) mg/d (range, 7-56 mg/d). Smokers reported significant reductions in both cigarettes per day (mean decrease, 18.4 +/- 11.5) confirmed by expired carbon monoxide (mean decrease, 13.5 +/- 13.0) with no significant changes in plasma nicotine concentrations during the course of NRT dose titration. There were significant effects on the subjective effects of smoking and measures of smoking behavior. Most commonly reported adverse events were respiratory infections, skin irritation at patch site, nausea, and sleep disturbances, which were generally mild and transient. Titrating doses of NRT to effect with brief intervention hold promise as an effective clinical strategy to assist heavily dependent psychiatrically ill smokers to change their smoking behavior.",0
Mobile Health-Based Health Literacy Weight Management Intervention Using Smart Devices for Adolescents: A Convergent Mixed-Methods Pilot Study,"This study aimed to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a mobile health-based health literacy weight management intervention program for adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, a convergent mixed-method design was used. The GO! GO! Smart Healthy intervention development engaged multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, utilizing mobile health applications and smartwatches. Participants provided data on weight management, dietary habits, and health literacy via an mHealth app, while smartwatches collected objective information on physical activity and sleep. The 12-week pilot study was conducted from March to September 2021. It evaluated the program's feasibility, employing both quantitative and thematic analyses of focus group discussions for a comprehensive assessment. Of the 27 participants, 44.4% were overweight or obese, with insufficient physical activity reported. Thematic analysis identified three main themes: empowerment, self-awareness and self-regulation, and self-comparison and reflection. Adolescents engaged with smartwatches, demonstrated increased awareness, altruistic behavior, and satisfaction. After integrating mixed-method data, revisions ensured the program's alignment with participants' preferences. Despite pandemic disruptions, mHealth apps ensured uninterrupted research, showcasing technology's evolving role in healthcare and education. Iterative feedback with participants ensured program suitability, fostering effectiveness.Trial Registration: : NCT04759716",0
Maintenance Scheduling Optimization in a Multiple Production Line Considering Human Error,"An analytical multiobjective maintenance planning model that maximizes reliability while minimizing cost and human error is proposed. In order to incorporate human error, the model minimizes the maximum human error over the planning horizon. Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) is used to quantify the human error. Maintenance activities include adjustment and replacement activities, in which each of them consumes a certain amount of human resource, spare parts, and budget and brings about a specified level of reliability and human error. Economic dependence is also considered, in which grouping maintenance activities reduces total cost. However, this may increase human error probability due to operator fatigue or time pressure. The main purpose is to investigate the relationship between human factors and maintenance activities to find the preferred maintenance plan. A multiple production line is considered as a case study. A sensitivity analysis is performed, and the effects of grouping and human factors on the preferred maintenance plan are discussed. It is shown how human proficiency may affect reliability and cost.",0
Inspiratory airflow dynamics during sleep in irritable bowel syndrome: a pilot study,"Purpose This study is a preliminary test of the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) derives from pharyngeal collapse during sleep.Materials and methods We studied inspiratory airflow dynamics during sleep in 12 lean females with IBS and 12 healthy female controls matched for age and obesity. A standard clinical polysomnogram (airflow measured with a nasal/oral pressure catheter) was performed to assess the impact of pharyngeal collapse on the participants' natural sleep. A second polysomnogram with a pneumotachograph and a supraglottic pressure catheter to measure airflow and effort was performed to compare the maximal inspiratory airflow and effort and the prevalence of inspiratory airflow limitation (IFL) during supine stage 2 sleep between groups.Results During clinical polysomnography, IBS participants did not differ significantly from controls in sleep architecture or respiration. The difference in apnea-hypopnea index between IBS participants and controls, however, approached statistical significance (2.8+/-2.7 vs 1.1+/-1.5, respectively; p=0.079). Although nine of the 12 IBS participants had a prevalence of IFL of at least 33% during supine stage 2 sleep, they did not differ from controls in maximal inspiratory airflow, inspiratory effort, or the prevalence of IFL. Controls, however, differed from IBS participants in having their prevalence of IFL during stage 2 sleep positively correlated with age (r=0.86; p=0.0003) while IBS participants demonstrated no relationship between the prevalence of IFL and age.Conclusions Our findings, while less than definitive, suggest a prevalence pattern of pharyngeal collapse during sleep among females with IBS that differs from that of healthy females, providing necessary background to inform further work on the relationship of pharyngeal collapse during sleep to IBS.",0
A Multimodal System for Assessing Alertness Levels Due to Cognitive Loading,"This paper proposes a scheme for assessing the alertness levels of an individual using simultaneous acquisition of multimodal physiological signals and fusing the information into a single metric for quantification of alertness. The system takes electroencephalogram, high speed image sequence, and speech data as inputs. Certain parameters are computed from each of these measures as indicators of alertness and a metric is proposed using a fusion of the parameters for indicating alertness level of an individual at an instant. The scheme has been validated experimentally using standard neuropsychological tests, such as the Visual Response Test (VRT), Auditory Response Test (ART), a Letter Counting (LC) task, and the Stroop Test. The tests are used both as cognitive tasks to induce mental fatigue as well as tools to gauge the present degree of alertness of the subject. Correlation between the measures has been studied and the experimental variables have been statistically analyzed using measures such as multivariate linear regression and analysis of variance. Correspondence of trends obtained from biomarkers and neuropsychological measures validate the usability of the proposed metric.",1
Structural health monitoring systems for bridge decks and rehabilitated precast prestress concrete beams,"Bridges are an integral part of a highway network and represent a multi-billion dollar investment. It is imperative that they are always open to traffic, resistant to natural disaster, and undaunted by millions of loading cycles per year. However, bridges are expensive to maintain and do occasionally fail. Early signs of deterioration are often not seen because concrete, some type of deck overlay, paint, protective wrap or other bridge components mask them.During service of bridge construction materials are subjected to degradation by aging; concrete cracks and creeps, steel oxides and may crack due to fatigue loading. The degradation of materials is caused by mechanical (loads higher then theoretically assumed) and physico-chemical factors (corrosion of steel, penetration of salts and chlorides in concrete, freezing of concrete etc.). As a consequence of material degradation, the capacity, durability and safety of structure decrease.Structural health monitoring is the diagnostic monitoring of the integrity or condition of a structure. The intent is to detect and locate damage or degradation in structural components and to provide this information quickly and in a form easily understood by the operators or occupants of the structure.In this study, a long-term structural health monitoring program was developed to identify any changes in the condition of the rehabilitated precast prestressed beams with CFRP over time due to sustained loads, traffic loads, and environmental exposure and to examine the performance of full-scale precast bridge deck under static and fatigue loading.",0
"Surveillance Monitoring Management for General Care Units: Strategy, Design, and Implementation.","BACKGROUND: The growing number of monitoring devices, combined with suboptimal patient monitoring and alarm management strategies, has increased alarm fatigue, which have led to serious consequences. Most reported alarm man- agement approaches have focused on the critical care setting. Since 2007 Dartmouth-Hitchcock (Lebanon, New Hamp- shire) has developed a generalizable and effective design, implementation, and performance evaluation approach to alarm systems for continuous monitoring in general care settings (that is, patient surveillance monitoring).METHODS: In late 2007, a patient surveillance monitoring system was piloted on the basis of a structured design and implementation approach in a 36-bed orthopedics unit. Beginning in early 2009, it was expanded to cover more than 200 inpatient beds in all medicine and surgical units, except for psychiatry and labor and delivery.RESULTS: Improvements in clinical outcomes (reduction of unplanned transfers by 50% and reduction of rescue events by more than 60% in 2008) and approximately two alarms per patient per 12-hour nursing shift in the original pilot unit have been sustained across most D-H general care units in spite of increasing patient acuity and unit occupancy. Sample analysis of pager notifications indicates that more than 85% of all alarm conditions are resolved within 30 seconds and that more than 99% are resolved before escalation is triggered.CONCLUSION: The D-H surveillance monitoring system employs several important, generalizable features to manage alarms in a general care setting: alarm delays, static thresholds set appropriately for the prevalence of events in this setting, directed alarm annunciation, and policy-driven customization of thresholds to allow clinicians to respond to needs of individual patients. The systematic approach to design, implementation, and performance management has been key to the success of the system.",0
You've Got a Friend in Me: Fostering Social Connection Among College Students Through Peer-Led Physical Activity.,"Social connection and physical activity (PA) are essential health behaviors necessary for young adults to thrive. The majority of college students in the United States are not meeting PA recommendations and simultaneously report concerning rates of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and fatigue; all factors that contribute to poor psychological well-being and reduce students' abilities to sustain academic success. These mental and physical health indicators have only worsened due to the stress, isolation, and uncertainty experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fitness Buddies (FB) is a free peer-led PA program designed to combat loneliness, stress, anxiety, depression, and low PA, by providing students the opportunity to connect with one another through PA. FB participants are matched with a peer leader for weekly PA sessions based on activity interests and schedules. The FB program model shifts the focus of traditional PA programs, from prescribing and monitoring PA duration, intensity and modalities, to supporting psychological well-being through satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness within peer PA-based relationships. In the first pilot phase of implementation, students reported improved situational affect, to include reduced stress and anxiety, following participation in the FB program for one academic semester. Participants also reported the development of quality peer relationships and a sense of belonging to the campus community, both of which had previously been lacking. The FB program model is an innovative and cost-efficient strategy to supporting college students' psychological well-being and long-term success.",0
The suitability of a caffeinated energy drink for night-shift workers,"Past research has indicated that caffeinated 'functional energy drinks' (FEDs) are effective in counteracting sleepiness. It is not known however, what impact FEDs have on sleep itself FEDs contain several active ingredients, including caffeine. They may therefore impact negatively on sleep and hence subsequent performance, deeming their use counterproductive. In a randomised cross-over design, 15 young adults participated in a simulated first night-shift protocol with 2 conditions, Functional Energy Drink (FED) and Non Functional Energy Drink (NonFED). Both involved a period of extended wakefulness (0700-0730h-24.5h) followed by an 8-h daytime 'recovery' sleep (0730-1530h). During the FED condition, a commercially available FED was administered twice during the night. Sleepiness was assessed during the period of extended wakefulness and for a further 6h after waking. Sleep periods were recorded using a standard 5 channel polysomnogram. Comparison of the sleep periods showed that sleep onset latency remained unchanged as did stage 2 and slow wave sleep. Total sleep time however, was 29.1 min shorter (p <.05) in the FED condition. Sleep efficiency was also significantly reduced from 91.8 +/-.9% to 84.7 +/- 2.7% (p <.05). It is evident that the residual effects of the FED's active ingredients impact on some aspects of daytime sleep following a simulated night-shift. Subsequent performance however was unaffected. The results deem FEDs to be effective for a single night-shift and warrant investigation into their use over successive night-shifts. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
Operational Vibration-Based Response Estimation for Offshore Wind Lattice Structures,"The design for fatigue for offshore wind turbine structures is characterized by uncertainty, resulting from both loading specifications and numerical modelling. At the same time, fatigue is a main design driver for this type of structures. This study presents a strategy to monitor the accumulated fatigue damage in real-time, employing a joint input-state estimation algorithm. Measuring the operational vibrations at well-chosen locations enables the estimation of strain responses at unmeasured locations. The estimation algorithm is applied to a wind turbine on a lattice support structure, for which the response estimates of the lattice members are based on measurements on the turbine tower only. This restriction follows from the difficulty to reliably and robustly measure at locations on the lattice structure. Artificial measurement data is generated with a full-order finite element model, while the strains are estimated with an erroneous reduced-order design model, after inclusion of measurement noise. The strain estimates show that the main frequency content can be captured relatively accurately, except for a small bias and some high frequency disturbance, corresponding to a weakly observable higher mode. This second aspect shows the importance of a trade-off between the accuracy of the reduced-order finite element model and the ill-conditioning of the observability matrix.",0
Effect of Low-Level Laser Therapy on Adolescents With Temporomandibular Disorder: A Blind Randomized Controlled Pilot Study,"Purpose: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy on pain, mandibular movements, and occlusal contacts in adolescents and young adults with temporomandibular disorder.Materials and Methods: Individuals aged 14 to 23 years were evaluated. The Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders were used for the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorders. Pain was assessed with a visual analog scale. Occlusal contacts were recorded using the T-Scan III program (Tekscan, Boston, MA). The participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups: active or placebo laser treatment. The laser parameters were as follows: wavelength of 780 nm, energy density of 33.5 J/cm(2), power of 50 mW, power density of 1.67 W/cm(2), and 20-second exposure time. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the normality of the data distribution. The paired t test was used for the comparisons of the pretreatment and post-treatment results. The SPSS program for Windows (version 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for all analyses, with the level of significance set at 5% (P < .05).Results: No statistically significant differences between groups were found for the right and left anterior temporal muscles (P = .3801 and P = .5595, respectively), superior masseter muscles (P = .087 and P = .1969, respectively), medial masseter muscles (P = .2241 and P = .076, respectively), or inferior masseter muscles (P = .5589 and P = .3268, respectively) after treatment.Conclusions: No statistically significant differences were found regarding pain, mandibular range of motion, or the distribution of occlusal contacts after treatment with low-level laser therapy. These preliminary results need to be verified in a larger sample of patients to confirm the lack of response to low-level laser therapy.

Pilot Trial of a Sleep-Promoting Intervention for Children With Type 1 Diabetes,"Objective To assess the feasibility and acceptability of an educational sleep-promoting intervention (Sleep Coach Jr.) for school-aged children (ages 5-9) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and their parents. Methods Parents and children (N = 39 dyads, mean child age = 8 years, 64% girls,) were randomized to either the Sleep Coach Jr. intervention, consisting of educational materials and three individual phone calls (N = 20), or the Standard Care condition (N = 19). Data were collected at enrollment and 3 months later. Children and parents wore actigraphy devices to obtain an objective measure of sleep characteristics, and parents completed questionnaire measures of sleep quality and psychosocial outcomes. Clinical data (i.e., hemoglobin A1c, glucose data) were obtained from children's medical records. Results Feasibility and acceptability of the study were demonstrated to be high; all three sessions were completed by 80% of parents randomized to the Sleep Coach Jr. intervention, and 90% of parents completed follow-up data at 3 months. Parents reported high levels of satisfaction with the study and identified barriers to participation. No changes were observed in children's sleep or diabetes outcomes, but parental sleep quality and well-being improved. Conclusions A brief, behavioral sleep-promoting intervention is feasible and acceptable for school-aged children with T1D and their parents. A larger trial is needed to evaluate efficacy of the intervention.",0
Regularized logistic regression for obstructive sleep apnea screening during wakefulness using daytime tracheal breathing sounds and anthropometric information,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent health problem. Developing a technology for quick OSA screening is momentous. In this study, we used regularized logistic regression to predict the OSA severity level of 199 individuals (116 males) with apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) >= 15 (moderate/severe OSA) and AHI < 5 (non-OSA) using their tracheal breathing sounds (TBS) recorded during daytime, while they were awake. The participants were guided to breathe through their nose, and then through their mouth at their deep breathing rate. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection approach was used to select the discriminative features from the power spectra of the TBS and the anthropometric information. Using a five-fold cross-validation procedure, five different training sets and their corresponding blind-testing sets were formed. The average blind-testing classification accuracy over the five different folds was found to be 79.3% +/- 6.1 with the sensitivity (specificity) of 82.2% +/- 7.2% (75.8% +/- 9.9%). The accuracy for the entire dataset was found to be 81.1% with sensitivity (specificity) of 84.4% (77.0%). The feature selection and classification procedures were intelligible and fast. The selected features were physiologically meaningful. Overall, the results show that TBS analysis can be used as a quick and reliable prediction of the presence and severity of OSA during wakefulness without a sleep study.",1
Optogenetic Manipulation of Neural Circuits During Monitoring Sleep/wakefulness States in Mice,"In recent years, optogenetics has been widely used in many fields of neuroscientific research. In many cases, an opsin, such as channel rhodopsin 2 (ChR2), is expressed by a virus vector in a particular type of neuronal cells in various Cre-driver mice. Activation of these opsins is triggered by application of light pulses which are delivered by laser or LED through optic cables, and the effect of activation is observed with very high time resolution. Experimenters are able to acutely stimulate neurons while monitoring behavior or another physiological outcome in mice. Optogenetics can enable useful strategies to evaluate function of neuronal circuits in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states in mice. Here we describe a technique for examining the effect of optogenetic manipulation of neurons with a specific chemical identity during electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) monitoring to evaluate the sleep stage of mice. As an example, we describe manipulation of GABAergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Acute optogenetic excitation of these neurons triggers a rapid transition to wakefulness when applied during NREM sleep. Optogenetic manipulation along with EEG/EMG recording can be applied to decipher the neuronal circuits that regulate sleep/wakefulness states.",0
An area efficient FPGA design for EEG signal denoising using LMS adaptive filtering and Teager-Kaiser energy operator,"An electroencephalogram is a technique to record the brain's electrical activity. It is a critical tool in diagnosing several disorders, such as sleep apnea. Hence, proper artifact removal from the EEG signal is indispensable. Since it is the recording of brain activity, there is a high susceptibility to error due to other biomedical signals. As a consequence, the removal of other signals or noise is critical to the accurate diagnosis of disorders. Many uses related to the EEG signal are real-time applications; hence, hardware-based denoising is the most viable solution. Area efficiency is one of the most important parameters to be considered in a FPGA-based system. Therefore, in this study, an area-efficient integration of an optimized cascaded least mean squared filter and a Teager-Kaiser energy operator is done. The cascaded LMS filter is then enhanced using distributed arithmetic and pipelining. Further, the Teager-Kaiser energy operator is refined by applying an approximate squarer. Then, this integration is compared with existing denoising techniques. This comparison has shown a reduction in area of almost 47% in registers and 61.2% decrease in terms of look-up tables. This architecture was synthesized using Xilinx Vivado 19.1, and the hardware description language used is Verilog HDL.",0
EVALUATION OF BICEPS BRACHII MUSCLE STRENGTH AND MUSCLE FATIGUE MODEL BASED ON SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAM (sEMG) SIGNALS,"This paper researches on the evaluation of biceps brachii muscle strength and muscle fatigue model based on surface Electromyogram (sEMG) signals. In this study, the fatigue status of biceps brachii during isometric stretching/extension under different load conditions was evaluated because the fatigue of upper limbs was related to the time, posture, position and frequency of exertion. The model can reflect these factors comprehensively. The results show that the quadratic curve evaluation model presented in this paper reflects a good relationship between fatigue energy and fatigue sensation and meets the test conditions of statistical regression. Therefore, in practical application, the fatigue energy value can be calculated according to the muscle sEMG signal collected, and the theoretical fatigue sensation can be calculated according to this model. In engineering application, the fatigue established in this paper can be used. Labour evaluation model is used to develop a fatigue condition monitoring device based on surface electromyogram (SEMG) signal, and then monitor the operator's fatigue state. It provides intuitive technical means for the design and planning of operation tasks and operator's fatigue evaluation.",0
Design and Control of the A-Arm: an Active Planar Arm Support for Adults with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,"Adults with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), due to their severe muscular weakness, cannot benefit from passive arm supports that only compensate for the weight of their arms. Active arm supports can potentially enable adults with DMD to perform activities of daily living, improving their independence, and increasing their participation in social activities. In this paper we present the A-Arm, an inconspicuous and simple planar active arm support for adults with DMD that can be controlled with force- or EMG-based interfaces. The A-Arm is intended to replace the arm rest of the wheelchair and assist during table top tasks such as computer, tablet, or smartphone use, writing and drawing, and the use of the wheelchair's joystick. In the force-based control interface we have implemented active compensation of the joint-stiffness forces using a measurement-based method to obtain an estimation of the voluntary forces of the user. A pilot evaluation with an adult with DMD (24 years-old, Brooke 5) has shown that the A-Arm was able to increase the functional workspace of the arm (from 100 cm 2 to 190-200 cm(2)). We found that while force-based control was experienced by the participant as more fatiguing than EMG-based control, the movements with EMG-based control were less accurate. These preliminary results give promising perspectives for the use of simple active arm supports to increase the independence of people with DMD.",0
Automatic Detection of Defective Rail Anchors,"Rail line anchors/fasteners are the metallic components that attach each line with the sleepers. These are essential rail components as absence of these often result in derailments. Therefore in order to prevent dangerous situations and ensuring safety rail lines are periodically inspected. Rail inspection in many countries especially in third world countries, like Bangladesh, is performed manually by a trained human operator who periodically walks along the track searching for visual anomalies. This manual inspection is lengthy, laborious and subjective.This paper presents a machine vision-based technique to automatically detect the presence of rail line anchors/fasteners using Shi - Tomasi and Harris - Stephen feature detection algorithms. This approach has confirmed to successfully detect scenarios with both grounded and missing anchors invoked in the experiment, with an accuracy of 83.55%, thus proving its robustness.",0
Tailoring Individualized Evaluation of Pediatric Abdominal Pain Using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) A Pilot Study Testing Feasibility and Acceptability,"Objective: The current study aimed to determine if it was feasible and acceptable to use ecological momentary assessment to assess individual associations between biopsychosocial contributors to chronic abdominal pain with 2 objective sensors and a mobile application. Specifically, we aimed to determine if it was possible to identify individualized associations between idiopathic pain associations. The goal was to determine if idiographic profiles have clinical value while the field works torward consensus about nomothetic trends. Materials and Methods: Participants included 30 pediatric chronic abdominal pain patients, aged 8 to 17, who wore a physiological monitor and accelerometer that measured sleep and physical activity and answered 4 surveys per day on an app over the course of a 14-day study period. Results: Results indicated that participants were 96.2% and 95.5% compliant to the wrist-worn accelerometer measuring sleep and physical activity, respectively. Participants completed 76.3% of expected surveys and were least adherent to the physiological monitor (37.9%). In addition, it was possible to generate 24 (80%) personalized reports describing unique associations with pain for participants in the study. Discussion: Findings provide initial support for the use of ecological momentary assessment over a 2-week period to inform and create personalized profiles for improved clinical care in this population.",0
An evaluation of the effects of methylphenidate on outcomes in adult epilepsy patients,"Purpose. To determine if methylphenidate (MPH) therapy can improve cognition in adult epilepsy patients on multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we assessed the impact of MPH on seizure activity, quality of life, cognition, and fatigue in patients with a primary diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy.Methods. This was an open-label, nonrandomized 3-month study. MPH (Ritalin) was added to patients' current antiepileptic drug regimens. Outcome measures included seizure activity, select AED serum concentrations, quality of life (via Quality of Life in Epilepsy-89 questions (QOLIE-89)), cognition (via Microcog), and fatigue (via a visual analog scale) at baseline and at monthly intervals for the treatment phase.Results. Eleven patients were enrolled and eight completed this pilot study. Of the eight completing the study, five were seizure-free at baseline and throughout the study. One patient had an increase, one a decrease, and one no change in seizure activity. No serious adverse events were observed. On average, serum AED concentrations changed <10% from baseline to the end of the study. Mean overall QOLIE-89 scores and select domains improved significantly from baseline.

"A longitudinal, randomized experimental pilot study to investigate the effects of airborne infrasound on human mental health, cognition, and brain structure","Airborne infrasound (IS; emitted by e.g., large machinery, wind farms) is ubiquitous in technologized environments. Health hazards are controversially discussed at present. This study investigated long-term effects of IS on brain (regional grey matter volume; rGMV) and behavior in humans. Specifically engineered infrasonic (6 Hz, 80-90 dB) vs. sham devices were installed in participants' (N=38) bedrooms and active for 28 nights. Somatic and psychiatric symptoms, sound-sensitivity, sleep quality, cognitive performance, and structural MRI were assessed pre-post. Null findings emerged for all behavioral variables. Exploratory analyses revealed a trend (p=.083) with individuals exposed to IS reporting more physical weakness at post-test (d=0.38). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) revealed no rGMV increases, but there were decreases within clusters in the cerebellum VIIIa (bilateral) and left angular gyrus (BA39) in verum. In conclusion, IS does not affect healthy individuals on a global scale. However, future trials should consider more fine-grained specific effects, combining self-report with physiological assessments, particularly directed at bodily sensations and perception. As no brain-behavior-links could be established, the identified grey matter decline cannot be interpreted in terms of potential harmfulness vs. improvement through IS-exposure. Parameters that may best reflect brain changes as established in the present study include motor function, sensory processing/ bodily- and motor-perceptions, working memory, and higher auditory processing (i.e., language-related tasks), which are hence potential target variables for further research.",0
Correlation between heart rate variability and pupillary reflex in healthy adult subjects under the influence of alcohol,"This study explored the association between pupil area variation, heart rate variability, and fatigue, caused by alcohol consumption. Sixteen healthy young male volunteers were enrolled in this study for a series of structured physical examinations. Individual drinking volume was strictly assessed in accordance with the normalized experimental design. The motions of the subjects' pupils, as well as electrocardiograms were recorded by a computerized recording system, both before and after drinking alcohol. After alcohol intake, the pupil diameter, and both low frequency and standard deviation of all heartbeat interval indices of heart rate variability showed significant variations compared with the baseline. In addition, time- and frequency-domain indices of heart rate variability were negatively associated with pupil area. Thus the current study suggests that fatigue status may be determined by significant changes in pupil area and heart rate variability.",0
Effects and safety of exergaming in persons with multiple sclerosis during corticosteroid treatment: a pilot study,"Background: There is no information about the effects and usability of rehabilitation during corticosteroid treatment. This randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate and compare the effects and safety of exergaming and conventional rehabilitation (CR) on persons with multiple sclerosis (MS, pwMS) during corticosteroid treatment. Methods: The participants were randomly divided into two groups: Exergaming (n=15) and CR (n=15). Rehabilitation was applied by a physiotherapist who has expertise in MS. Measurements were done at baseline (T1), immediately after discharge (T2), and 1 month after discharge (T3). The outcome measures included upper extremity functions, walking, balance, cognitive functions, quality of life, depression, and fatigue. Results: The Nine Hole Peg Test, California Verbal Learning Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, MS Walking Scale 12, Six Spot Step Test showed a significant difference between T1 to T2 and T1 to T3 in the exergaming and CR groups (p < 0.05). The Timed 25 Foot Walk and Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire were significantly different between T1 to T3 in the exergaming and CR groups (p < 0.05). Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised was significantly different between T1 to T3 and T2 to T3 in the exergaming and CR groups (p < 0.05). The MFIS showed a significant difference between T1 to T2 and T1 to T3 in the exergaming group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study suggests that exergaming and CR are effective and safe methods for improving upper extremity, cognitive functions, fatigue, quality of life, balance, and walking ability in pwMS during the hospitalization period.",0
"The effect of ketamine on hypoventilation during deep sedation with midazolam and propofol A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND Hypoventilation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients having procedures under sedation. Few clinical strategies have been evaluated to reduce intraoperative hypoventilation during surgical procedures under deep sedation.OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this investigation was to examine the effect of ketamine on hypoventilation in patients receiving deep sedation for surgery with midazolam and propofol.DESIGN The study was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.SETTING Intraoperative.PATIENTS Healthy women undergoing breast surgery.INTERVENTION Randomised to receive ketamine (0.5mgkg-(1) bolus, followed by an infusion of 1.5mgkg(-1) min(-1)) or isotonic saline.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Duration of hypercapnia measured continuously with a transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TCO2) monitor.RESULTS Fifty-four participants were recruited. Patient and surgical characteristics were similar between the study groups. The median percentage of the sedation time with TCO2 more than 6.7 kPa in participants in the ketamine group, 1.2% (95% confidence interval, CI, 0 to 83), was less than that in the isotonic saline group (65%, 95% CI, 0 to 88; P = 0.01). Severe hypoventilation (TCO2 > 8.0 kPa) was also less in the ketamine group, median 0% (95% CI, 0 to 11.7) compared with 28% (95% CI, 0 to 79.3; P = 0.0002) for the isotonic saline group. The ketamine group required less airway manoeuvres (chin lift) to keep the SaO2 greater than 95% median (95% CI) [0 (0 to 3) compared with 3 (0 to 16) in the isotonic saline group] (P = 0.004).CONCLUSION Ketamine decreased the duration and severity of hypercapnia in patients undergoing deep sedation with propofol. The addition of ketamine may reduce hypoventilation and adverse effects in patients having procedures under sedation.",0
Fuzzy-Logic Decision Fusion for Nonintrusive Early Detection of Driver Fatigue or Drowsiness,"Traffic accidents due to falling asleep at the wheel are a longstanding problem in many countries. This paper presents a novel solution based on fuzzy-logic decision fusion that prevents accidents by detecting driver fatigue or drowsiness early. The proposed method is based on analyzing and inferring about certain biological and behavioral measurements that enable detection of reduced alertness preceding driver-sleep onset. Because wakeful or sleep activity is reflected in several physiological conditions in human beings, such as cardiac, breathing, movement, and skin galvanic conductance, captured bioelectric signal features were extracted and fuzzy decision-fusion logic was tuned to make inferences about oncoming driver fatigue or drowsiness. The proposed method improves the performance by applying the fuzzy logic inference to fuse decisions from independent modules that infer about features measured on the sensed physiologic and/or behavioral information. The method reduces the complexity of the signal processing and of the pattern matching model. Tests have been executed on clinical and in field physiologic and behavioral data. A prototype based on a 32 bit microcontroller and a highly integrated analog front-end has been developed to support the in field tests.",1
A human digital twin approach for fatigue-aware task planning in human-robot collaborative assembly,"Human-robot collaboration (HRC) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm in manufacturing, integrating the strengths of both human and robot capabilities. Neglecting human physical fatigue may adversely affect worker health and, in extreme cases, may lead to musculoskeletal disorders. However, human fatigue has rarely been considered for decision-making in HRC manufacturing systems. Integrating adaptive decision-making to optimise human fatigue in HRC manufacturing systems is crucial. Nonetheless, real-time perception and estimation of human fatigue and decision-making informed by human fatigue face considerable challenges. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a human digital twin method, a bidirectional communication system for physical fatigue assessment and reduction in human-robot collaborative assembly tasks. The methodology encompasses an IK-BiLSTM-AM-based surrogate model, which consists of inverse kinematics analysis (IK), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and attention mechanism (AM), for real-time muscle force estimation integrated with a muscle force-fatigue model for muscle fatigue assessment. An And-Or graph and optimisation model-based HRC task planner is also developed to alleviate physical fatigue via task allocation. The efficacy of this approach has been validated through proof-of-concept assembly experiments involving multiple subjects. The results show that the IK-BiLSTM-AM model achieves a minimum of 8% greater accuracy in muscle force estimation than the baseline methods. The 12-subject assessment results indicate that the task planner effectively reduces the physical fatigue of workers while performing collaborative assembly tasks.",1
"Aeroallergens, allergic rhinitis, and sedating antihistamines: Risk factors for traumatic occupational injury and economic impact","Background. The U.S. workplace injury burden is significant. Our objective was to assess the particular impact of aeroallergen, allergic rhinitis, and antihistamine exposures and side effects on the risk of traumatic work-related injuries, and the associated economic impact.Methods. This is an observational case-control study with 1,223 acute traumatic injury cases that are compared to 1,202 chronic back injury controls. Structured telephone interviews were conducted in 1998 and 1999 on Workers' Compensation applicants injured in 1997. Antihistamine use and pollen levels were measured 2 weeks prior to the injury date.Results. Sedating antihistamine exposures elevated acute injury risk (main effect OR: 2.93). A significant increase in traumatic injury risk was observed for combined sedating antihistamine and high pollen exposures among subjects with physician and self-diagnosed allergic rhinitis (OR: 2.41). Direct medical costs associated with this increased risk were estimated at $143 million in 2001.Conclusions. Workers with physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis have as high a reliance on sedating antihistamines as do self-diagnosed and self-medicating nasal allergy sufferers. High pollen exposures along with sedating antihistamine use may confer significant additional injury risks among allergic rhinitis sufferers. Medical management best practices of diagnosed allergic rhinitis should include avoidance of sedating antihistamines to minimize acute, traumatic injury risks. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",0
ASSESSMENT OF JERK AS A METHOD OF PHYSICAL FATIGUE DETECTION,"Workers' fatigue is a significant problem in physically demanding occupations. Physical fatigue is known to result in the inability to maintain proper posture and working technique. Consequently, workers lose their ability to safely and effectively perform their duties. Thus, understanding the physical demands of labor-intensive work is of great importance in protecting workers' safety, and maintaining productivity. Current fatigue assessments methods, including surveys and questionnaires, are subjective and lack reliability. Objective fatigue assessments based on physiological data are more reliable, however they are cumbersome to implement in real work conditions. There is a need for an objective fatigue assessment method that can monitor physical fatigue with minimal intrusion. The goal of this study was to investigate whether jerk, the time-derivative of acceleration, can be used to objectively detect physical fatigue. A pilot study on masons was conducted to determine if physical fatigue can be detected by changes in jerk values. Ten participants performed a bricklaying task using forty-five concrete masonry units (CMU). Seven body segments, namely the hands, forearms, upper arms, and pelvis, were selected for placement of IMU sensors to measure the segment accelerations. Jerk was calculated from the measured acceleration via numerical differentiation. Characteristic values of the jerk at the beginning and end of the bricklaying task were obtained to represent the rested and fatigued states. They were then compared for significant differences. Jerk values calculated from the IMU sensors located on the upper arms and pelvis showed significant differences between rested and fatigued states. The results of this pilot study indicate that the characteristic jerk can be used to detect physical fatigue, however caution must be taken in selecting sensor locations to reduce the influence of spurious signals.",1
Association between children's exposure to a violent event and objectively and subjectively measured sleep characteristics: a pilot longitudinal study,"Although sleep disturbances are commonly reported among children exposed to violence, objective evidence of such disturbances is rare. This longitudinal, home-based study assessed the effects of a known community-or family-violence incident on both actigraphy-derived and subjectively reported sleep outcomes of an ethnically mixed, urban sample of children aged 8-16 years. We hypothesized that increased event severity (child physical assault, witnessed homicide) would be associated with lower sleep duration and poorer sleep quality both at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. Covariate-adjusted analyses based on a generalized estimating equations approach showed that children physically assaulted during the event showed lower sleep duration and sleep efficiency and greater wake after sleep onset than those not physically assaulted. Physically assaulted children were more likely to have a later bedtime than non-assaulted children, but this difference decreased at 3 months. Children witnessing a homicide showed greater wake after sleep onset at baseline and reported greater sleep problems than those witnessing a non-homicide event, but these differences decreased at 3 months. They were also somewhat more likely to have greater nightly variation in sleep duration. Collectively, results suggest that violence exposure influences children's sleep, but that specific dimensions of sleep may exhibit different susceptibility to different characteristics of violence, especially over time.",0
Towards Detecting Levels of Alertness in Drivers Using Multiple Modalities,"Distracted and drowsy driving are two very common causes of car accidents as they contribute to 2.3% of all the fatalities caused on the US roads. Therefore, in the era of smart driving there is an increased need of technologies able to monitor driver's alertness and provide timely alerts to the driver. In this paper, we conduct as pilot study and we present a preliminary, yet novel multimodal dataset, collected from 10 subjects using three different modalities. Our modalities include a thermal camera, an RGB camera, and four physiological indicators. The dataset consists of two recording sessions for each subject, thus, offering in total 20 multimodal driving sessions. We propose a machine learning framework aiming to investigate the hypothesis that multimodal features have higher potential towards driver alertness detection. Our dataset and analysis focus on exploring the differences between alertness and drowsiness as they intersect with the presence of different distractions. The results highlight the validity of our hypothesis and introduce interesting future directions for research.",1
"Demographic and Cardiovascular Risk Factors Associated with Drug Use in Truck Drivers in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil: A Cross-Sectional Study","The aim of the study is to analyze the association between risk factors for the health of truck drivers and previous use of illicit drugs. A cross-sectional study examined the data from 2071 truck drivers between 2010 and 2016. Demographic variables, risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the use of illicit drugs were analyzed. The stepwise logistic regression model was used for the adjusted analysis. The dependent variable was the previous use of illicit drugs, and independent variables were those with p < 0.1 at a bivariate analysis. The average age of the truck drivers was 42.27 +/- 11.07 years, and the previous use of illicit drugs was reported or detected in 388 (18.7%) drivers. Compared to non-users, drug users were younger (37.25 +/- 9.45 vs. 43.43 +/- 11.1 years; p < 0.001) and single (43.3% vs. 28.4%; p < 0.001). The independent variables for illicit drugs were age (OR = 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.95; p < 0.001)), smoking (OR = 2.18 (95% CI: 1.39-3.44; p = 0.001)), alcohol consumption (OR = 1.626 (95% CI: 1.06-2.49; p = 0.026)) and driving hours per day (OR = 1.08 (95% CI: 1.01-1.15; p = 0.012)). Users of illicit drugs had multiple risk factors for CVD and traffic accidents.",0
"Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 6 weeks to treat acute hepatitis C virus genotype 1 or 4 infection in patients with HIV coinfection: an open-label, single-arm trial","Background The latest European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines now recommend that patients with acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection should be treated with a combination of sofosbuvir and an NS5A inhibitor for 8 weeks. However, the ideal duration of treatment with interferon-free regimens, particularly in HIV-coinfected individuals, remains unknown. We assessed the efficacy and safety of 6 weeks of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for acute genotype 1 or 4 HCV in HIV-1-coinfected patients.Methods This open-label, single-arm trial, done in Germany and the UK, included patients with acute HCV genotype 1 or 4 and HIV-1. At screening, patients were either receiving HIV antiretrovirals and had HIV RNA less than 200 copies per mL, or not receiving antiretrovirals and had a CD4 T-cell count of greater than 500 cells per mu L. All patients received ledipasvir-sofosbuvir once daily for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained virological response 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02457611.Findings Between June 11, 2015, and Jan 8, 2016, we enrolled and treated 26 patients. All (100%) were men, 24 (92%) were white, and 25 (96%) were receiving antiretroviral treatment. 19 (73%) had genotype 1a and seven (27%) had genotype 4 HCV. Overall, 20 (77%; 95% CI 56-91) of 26 patients achieved SVR12: 15 (79%) of 19 with genotype 1a, and five (71%) of seven with genotype 4. Of six patients not achieving SVR12, three relapsed, two achieved sustained virological response 4 weeks after the end of treatment but were lost to follow-up, and one was reinfected. The most common adverse events were fatigue (seven participants [27%]), nasopharyngitis (seven [27%]), and headache (six [23%]). No patient discontinued or interrupted therapy due to adverse events. No HIV rebound occurred during the study.Interpretation The rate of cure with a fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for patients with acute genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection and HIV-1 coinfection is similar to historic rates with interferon-based treatment, but with shorter treatment duration and more favourable safety outcomes.",0
EVOLUTION OF THERMAL INTERFACE MATERIAL-TO-COPPER INTERFACIAL FRACTURE TOUGHNESS SUBJECTED TO MONOTONIC AND FATIGUE LOADING AFTER THERMAL CYCLING,"Automotive electronics increasingly use high-performance semiconductors to enable a number of advanced driver assistance systems. Thermal management in chip-based electronic systems is quickly becoming one of the most significant impediments to enhanced performance and integration density. The ongoing downsizing and integration of semiconductor devices have increased by heat generated per unit volume of the chip. Thermal interface material (TIM) facilitates heat dissipation from chip to package and from package to heat sink. Exposure to the wide temperature ranges typical in automotive conditions may result in the early propagation of fractures at the TIM-to-Copper contact, leading to high thermal resistance and device thermal runaway. In this paper, bi-material samples have been created by dispensing TIM materials onto the copper surface and curing them based on the specified conditions. A total of three different TIM materials are used in this study. Two types of samples are prepared, namely with and without pre-crack. The samples are tested in four-point bend monotonic and fatigue loading conditions. The pre-cracked samples are used for fatigue four-point bend loading, and the no-pre-crack samples are used for monotonic four-point bend loading. Before testing, to calculate the bi-material samples' KIC and KIIC fracture toughness values, they are subjected to automotive-grade thermal cycling from -40 degrees C to +125 degrees C for up to 1000 cycles. Interfacial crack initiation, propagation, and failure mechanisms are investigated. The interfaces' strain-energy release rate and fracture toughness are assessed.",0
Deep Neuro-Vision Embedded Architecture for Safety Assessment in Perceptive Advanced Driver Assistance Systems: The Pedestrian Tracking System Use-Case,"In recent years, the automotive field has been changed by the accelerated rise of new technologies. Specifically, autonomous driving has revolutionized the car manufacturer's approach to design the advanced systems compliant to vehicle environments. As a result, there is a growing demand for the development of intelligent technology in order to make modern vehicles safer and smarter. The impact of such technologies has led to the development of the so-called Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), suitable to maintain control of the vehicle in order to avoid potentially dangerous situations while driving. Several studies confirmed that an inadequate driver's physiological condition could compromise the ability to drive safely. For this reason, assessing the car driver's physiological status has become one of the primary targets of the automotive research and development. Although a large number of efforts has been made by researchers to design safety-assessment applications based on the detection of physiological signals, embedding them into a car environment represents a challenging task. These mentioned implications triggered the development of this study in which we proposed an innovative pipeline, that through a combined less invasive Neuro-Visual approach, is able to reconstruct the car driver's physiological status. Specifically, the proposed contribution refers to the sampling and processing of the driver PhotoPlethysmoGraphic (PPG) signal. A parallel enhanced low frame-rate motion magnification algorithm is used to reconstruct such features of the driver's PhotoPlethysmoGraphic (PPG) data when that signal is no longer available from the native embedded sensor platform. A parallel monitoring of the driver's blood pressure levels from the PPG signal as well as the driver's eyes dynamics completes the reconstruction of the driver's physiological status. The proposed pipeline has been tested in one of the major investigated automotive scenarios i.e., the detection and monitoring of pedestrians while driving (pedestrian tracking). The collected performance results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0
Pilot study: specific immunotherapy in patients with Papular urticaria by Cimex lectularius.,"Summary: Background. Papular urticaria is a chronic allergic reaction induced by insect bites. In Mexico the most common causative arthropods reported are bed bugs, fleas and mosquitoes. Approximately 70% of people who are bitten by Cimex lectularius experience hypersensitive reactions, papular urticaria, extensive erythema, urticaria, and even anaphylaxis has been reported, pruritus is the major complaint, impairing quality of life and sleep. Immunotherapy has been used in mosquito bite papular urticaria resulting in improvement of skin lesions and possibly protecting against reactions to subsequent exposures to mosquitoes. Methods. Children, 4-10 years of age, with recurrent papular urticaria due to bedbugs not responsive to multiple treatments were included. An initial allergy assessment included clinical history, skin prick test (SPT), and specific IgE sensitisation was performed to confirmed bedbug sensitization. Twenty children were randomized to receive subcutaneous specific immunotherapy (SSI) with whole body bed bug extract or conventional treatment. The treatment was carried out over twelve months and the response was assessed using the Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQ), the immunotherapy satisfaction questionnaire (ESPIA questionnaire) and the 12-Item Pruritus Severity Scale (12-IPSS). The results from both the treated and control groups were compared. Results. The twenty patients were randomized, 12 to receive immunotherapy and 8 to receive conventional treatment for 12 months. Quality of life improved with a reduction in the DLQI score of 19.83 in the immunotherapy group versus 9 in the conventional treatment group (p = 0.03). Itch improved with a reduction in the 12-IPSS of 16.5 in the immunotherapy group versus 9.63 in the conventional treatment group (p = 0.02). After twelve months of treatment, all 12 patients who received immunotherapy, reported a decrease of persistent cutaneous lesions but the 8 on conventional treatment did not. A mean score of 95.75 (SD 3.3) was recorded for satisfaction with immunotherapy. Conclusions. Patients with papular urticaria by Cimex lectularius receiving allergen immunotherapy for 1 year showed a significant improvement compared with baseline and patients receiving conventional treatment regarding skin lesions, quality of life impairment, intensity of pruritus and satisfaction with immunotherapy.",0
"Simulated driving under the influence of extended wake, time of day and sleep restriction","Around a fifth of all road accidents can be attributed to fatigued drivers. Previous studies indicate that driving performance is influenced by time of day and decreases with sustained wakefulness. However, these influences occur naturally in unison, confounding their effects. Typically, when people drive at a poor time of day and with extended wake, their sleep is also restricted. Hence, the aim of the current study was to determine the independent effects of prior wake and time of day on driving performance under conditions of sleep restriction. The driving performance of fourteen male participants (21.8 +/- 3.8 years, mean +/- SD) was assessed during a 10 min simulated driving task with speed/lane mean, variability and violations (speeding and crashes) measured. Participants were tested at 2.5 h intervals after waking, across 7 x 28 h days with a sleep:wake ratio of 1:5. By forced desynchrony each driving session occurred at 9 doses of prior wake and within 6 divisions of the circadian cycle based on core body temperature. A mixed models ANOVA revealed significant main effects of circadian phase, prior wake and sleep debt on lane violations. In addition, three significant two-way interactions (circadian phase x prior wake, prior wake x sleep debt, sleep debt x circadian phase) and one three-way interaction (circadian x prior wake x sleep debt) were identified. The presence of the large interaction effects shows that the influence of each factor is largely dependent on the magnitude of the other factors. For example, the presence of the time of day influence on driving performance is dependent on the length of prior wake or the presence of sleep debt. The findings suggest that people are able to undertake a low-difficulty simulated drive safely, at least for a short period, during their circadian nadir provided that they have had sufficient sleep and have not been awake too long.

Fatigue crack closure assessment by wavelet transform of infrared thermography signals,"The occurrence of crack closure significantly impacts the fatigue life of materials and structural components. Whether it is induced by the nature of the loading, the fabrication process or the geometry of the structure, its magnitude and effect should be considered to further improve predictive models of fatigue crack propagation. However, the definition of reliable experimental methods for the observation and assessment of fatigue crack closure, and in particular suited to structure testing, remains a challenge. The present study aims to provide a novel approach for the assessment of fatigue crack closure via the continuous wavelet transform of infrared thermography data. The processing of the temperature signal close to the crack in a coherent time-frequency space allows for the identification of crack closing and opening instants associated with high-frequency components. The method is meant to be suited to any testing configuration (conventional compact tension specimen or full-scale structures) with minimum operator-dependent parameters.",0
Leveraging big data for causal understanding in mental health: a research framework,"Over the past 30 years there have been numerous large-scale and longitudinal psychiatric research efforts to improve our understanding and treatment of mental health conditions. However, despite the huge effort by the research community and considerable funding, we still lack a causal understanding of most mental health disorders. Consequently, the majority of psychiatric diagnosis and treatment still operates at the level of symptomatic experience, rather than measuring or addressing root causes. This results in a trial-and-error approach that is a poor fit to underlying causality with poor clinical outcomes. Here we discuss how a research framework that originates from exploration of causal factors, rather than symptom groupings, applied to large scale multi-dimensional data can help address some of the current challenges facing mental health research and, in turn, clinical outcomes. Firstly, we describe some of the challenges and complexities underpinning the search for causal drivers of mental health conditions, focusing on current approaches to the assessment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, the many-to-many mappings between symptoms and causes, the search for biomarkers of heterogeneous symptom groups, and the multiple, dynamically interacting variables that influence our psychology. Secondly, we put forward a causal-orientated framework in the context of two large-scale datasets arising from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States, and the Global Mind Project which is the largest database in the world of mental health profiles along with life context information from 1.4 million people across the globe. Finally, we describe how analytical and machine learning approaches such as clustering and causal inference can be used on datasets such as these to help elucidate a more causal understanding of mental health conditions to enable diagnostic approaches and preventative solutions that tackle mental health challenges at their root cause.",0
Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation Score to Guide Mask Selection in CPAP-Treated Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Nasal obstruction is frequently reported by patients with sleep apnea and complicates the choice of a nasal or oronasal mask for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. However, the type of interface used for the delivery of CPAP is crucial to ensure tolerance and compliance. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to identify whether the validated Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score rated at CPAP initiation was associated with the type of mask used after 4 months of treatment. Patients completed the NOSE questionnaire before initiation with automatic CPAP. The mask used (nasal/oronasal) after 4 months was documented. In total, 198 consecutive patients with sleep apnea were included. NOSE score (>50/100) was independently associated with the use of an oronasal mask at 4 months (sensitivity, 34.8%; specificity, 87.5%). The NOSE questionnaire could be a simple decision-making tool to guide the choice of mask during CPAP initiation.",0
Adapted physical activity in old age: Effects of a low-intensity training program on isokinetic power and fatigability,"Background and aims: This pilot study measured the effects of an original low-intensity training program, called posture-balancing-mobility (PBM), on muscular function. Methods: Nine non-disabled, elderly (74.3 +/- 6 years) subjects were trained with the PBM technique for 11 weeks (2 sessions per week). Mean power and fatigue index parameters were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer before and after training and compared with those recorded in another group of 9 elderly (71.1 +/- 4.3 years) subjects, who had performed aquatic exercises during the same period and with the same frequency. Results: The mean power of the knee extension muscles increased slightly but significantly on the dominant (15.6%, p<0.05) and non-dominant sides (13.4%, p<0.05) in the PBM group, with no significant fatigue index variation. None of the parameters changed significantly for the aquatic group, and comparison of variations obtained in the two groups showed no significant difference between their respective effects. Conclusions: Although the results showed slightly enhanced strength production in the PBM group, the low statistical power does not allow conclusions about the impact of this type of training intervention in its current form. Nevertheless, this pilot study provides some indication. of the benefits that can be obtained from such an individualized approach. Its efficiency would most likely be improved by further exploration of the minimal threshold of intensity required for strength exercises and by measurement of its effect on functions involving neuromuscular parameters, such as balance or gait.",0
Marker load-aided bidirectional fatigue crack growth rate measurement via a semi-elliptical surface crack,"It is always impractical to measure the fatigue crack growth rate in the thickness direction of a plate using a standard specimen because of the limited plate thickness. To address this issue, we proposed a method for crack growth rate measurements utilizing a semi-elliptical surface crack, the size of which is determined via marker bands. This method allows the crack growth rates both in the surface direction and the thickness direction to be measured in a single test. The core of the method involves the load spectrum development and the crack growth data analyses. In the load spectrum development, the number of marker load cycles in a load block is estimated through a crack growth equation including the crack closure effect, while the interval of marker load blocks is determined using the crack length measured in a pilot test. The estimated parameters can be amended using the crack growth data acquired by fractographic analyses, should unclear marker bands or unreasonable band spacing occur. In the crack growth data analyses, a closed stress intensity factor solution for a surface-cracked plate with clamped ends was developed, facilitating stress intensity factor calculations. Finally, we demonstrated an application of the proposed method, i.e. fatigue crack growth rate measurements for Ti-6Al-4 V plates. Fine and legible marker bands were observed by fractography, and the resulting da/dN-Delta K curve was consistent with the curves obtained by using standard specimens, justifying the proposed method.",0
Driver fatigue and drowsiness monitoring system with embedded electrocardiogram sensor on steering wheel,"Real time driver health condition monitoring system with drowsiness alertness was proposed. A new embedded electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor with electrically conductive fabric electrodes on the steering wheel of a car was designed to monitor the driver's health condition. The ECG signals were measured at a sampling rate of 100 Hz from the driver's palms as they stay on a pair of conductive fabric electrodes located on the steering wheel. Practical tests were conducted using an embedded ECG sensor with a wireless sensor node, and their performance was assessed under non-stop 2 h driving test. The ECG signals were measured and transmitted wirelessly to a base station connected to a server PC in personal area network environment. The driver's health condition such as the normal, fatigued and drowsy states was analysed by evaluating the heart rate variability in the time and frequency domains.",1
Multimodal Gaze-Based Interaction in Cars: Are Mid-Air Gestures with Haptic Feedback Safer Than Buttons?,"We studied two interaction techniques to perform secondary tasks in a driving simulator environment with the focus on driving safety. In both techniques, the participants (N = 20) used gaze pointing to select virtual task buttons. Toggling the controlswas achieved by either mid-air gestureswith haptic feedback or physical buttons located on the steering wheel. To evaluate each technique, we compared several measures, such as mean task times, pedestrian detections, lane deviations, and task complexity ratings.The results showed that both techniques allowed operation without severely compromising driving safety. However, interaction using gestures was rated as more complex, caused more fatigue and frustration, and pedestrians were noticed with longer delays than using physical buttons. The results suggest that gaze pointing accuracy was not always sufficient, while mid-air gestures require more robust algorithms before they can offer functionality comparable to interaction with physical buttons.",0
PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN MYASTHENIA GRAVIS IS SAFE AND IMPROVES NEUROMUSCULAR PARAMETERS AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE-BASED MEASURES: A PILOT STUDY,"Introduction: Due to the shortage of exercise-related research in Myasthenia Gravis (MG), there are no consensus guidelines on physical exercise for MG patients. Methods: In this prospective pilot study, 10MG patients with mild disease performed supervised aerobic and resistance training twice weekly for 12 weeks. The Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score, compound motor action potential (CMAP), repetitive nerve stimulation, muscle force, physical performance-based measures, serum levels of interleukin-6, muscle enzymes, and immuno-microRNAs miR-150-5p and miR-21-5p were assessed before and after the training period. Results: Physical exercise was well tolerated, and the MGC score was unchanged. Muscle resistance weights and CMAP amplitudes increased for biceps brachii and rectus femoris muscles, and physical performance-based measures improved. Muscle enzymes remained normal, whereas disease-specific microRNAs miR-150-5p and miR-21-5p were reduced after the training period. Conclusions: We propose that general recommendations regarding physical exercise can be applied safely to well-regulated MG patients.",0
Steering a Tractor by Means of an EMG-Based Human-Machine Interface,"An electromiographic (EMG)-based human-machine interface (HMI) is a communication pathway between a human and a machine that operates by means of the acquisition and processing of EMG signals. This article explores the use of EMG-based HMIs in the steering of farm tractors. An EPOC, a low-cost human-computer interface (HCI) from the Emotiv Company, was employed. This device, by means of 14 saline sensors, measures and processes EMG and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from the scalp of the driver. In our tests, the HMI took into account only the detection of four trained muscular events on the driver's scalp: eyes looking to the right and jaw opened, eyes looking to the right and jaw closed, eyes looking to the left and jaw opened, and eyes looking to the left and jaw closed. The EMG-based HMI guidance was compared with manual guidance and with autonomous GPS guidance. A driver tested these three guidance systems along three different trajectories: a straight line, a step, and a circumference. The accuracy of the EMG-based HMI guidance was lower than the accuracy obtained by manual guidance, which was lower in turn than the accuracy obtained by the autonomous GPS guidance; the computed standard deviations of error to the desired trajectory in the straight line were 16 cm, 9 cm, and 4 cm, respectively. Since the standard deviation between the manual guidance and the EMG-based HMI guidance differed only 7 cm, and this difference is not relevant in agricultural steering, it can be concluded that it is possible to steer a tractor by an EMG-based HMI with almost the same accuracy as with manual steering.",0
Accuracy of the sleep-related breathing disorder scale to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea in children: a meta-analysis,"Objectives: The main objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the accuracy of the Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder (SRBD) Scale in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.Patients/methods: A literature search of studies comparing SRBD to polysomnography for the diagnosis of OSAS in children was performed. Risks of biases were quantified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. Analyses determined the summary receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (SROC), the pooled sensitivity (Se), the specificity (Sp), and the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-).Results were graded and are expressed as means [95% confidence interval]. Post-test probabilities were computed for various populations. Results: Eleven studies were included; and two were considered to have high risk of bias. The SROC was 0.73 [CI: 0.63; 0.82]. The combined Se, Sp, LR+ and LR- were: 0.72 [CI: 0.68; 0.77], 0.59 [CI: 0.56; 0.63], 1.74 [CI: 1.32; 2.30], 0.53 [CI: 0.39; 0.71], respectively. Sub-group analyses displayed similar results in comparison to overall results. GRADE evidence for the overall analysis was low to moderate. Finally, pretest to post-test probabilities were estimated to be: 3.5%-1%, 50%-30% and 75%-30%, for the general population, the obese patients and the patients assigned for surgical treatment of OSAS, respectively.Conclusions: The current meta-analysis indicates that the SRBD scale has acceptable accuracy in detecting patients with OSAS. It may be useful when evaluating patients with suspected OSAS before surgery. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
Evidence-based practice for fatigue management in adults with cancer: Exercise as an intervention,"Purpose/Objectives: To review and summarize the current state of the evidence for exercise as an intervention for cancer-related fatigue and to facilitate application to clinical practice.Data Sources: Articles, abstracts, and practice guidelines published through October 2003.Data Synthesis: The strength of the evidence of effectiveness of exercise in managing cancer-related fatigue is growing.Conclusions: All patients with cancer should be encouraged to maintain an optimum level of physical activity during and following cancer treatment. Patients with breast cancer and other selected patients should receive recommendations for moderate exercise programs. Referrals to physical therapy and/or rehabilitation may benefit certain patients, including those with comorbidities or deconditioning. Published multidisciplinary evidence-based guidelines for exercise programs involving patients with cancer are needed.Implications for Nursing: Nurses may participate in implementing exercise interventions with patients with cancer in various roles depending on skill and knowledge-from encouraging physical activity to referring patients to physical therapy and/or rehabilitation programs to prescribing and monitoring exercise in certain patient populations.",0
Comprehensive analysis of hypoxia-related gene signature in cervical cancer,"Hypoxia significantly influences the growth, metastasis and treatment resistance of cervical cancer (CC), thereby affecting patient prognosis. However, accurately predicting CC survival remains challenging, and the potential of hypoxia-related genes as prognostic markers remains uncertain. In this study, using CC single-cell transcriptional data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we employed the InferCNV package to identify tumor cells and used CellChat to confirm stronger intercellular interactions in tumor cells with high-hypoxia status. Next, we identified differentially expressed hypoxia-related genes (DEHLGs) by analyzing data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression, and Molecular Signature Database, which were further screened using univariate Cox regression and lasso regression analyses, based on which we constructed a hypoxia prognosis model comprising nine prognosis-related genes. Risk scores were generated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. The prognosis model revealed that the overall survival rate was higher in the low-risk than in the high-risk group. The model's performance was assessed using the area under the time-dependent receiver operator characteristic curve, which yielded values of 0.836 and 0.804 for the training and test groups, respectively, indicating a robust prognostic capability of the model. A nomogram based on the nine hypoxia-related genes and training groups exhibited a favorable discriminatory ability for CC. Additionally, using CIBERSORT, we estimated the proportion of immune cells in patients with high-and low-hypoxia risk, revealing a higher proportion of macrophages (M0) and activated mast cells in the high-risk group. We successfully established a prognostic model for CC based on nine hypoxia-related genes to accurately predict the prognosis of affected patients.",0
Evaluation of a Distance Reiki Program for Frontline Healthcare Workers' Health-Related Quality of Life During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Background: Reiki is a biofield therapy which is based on the explanatory model that the fields of energy and information of living systems can be influenced to promote relaxation and stimulate a healing response.Objective: To conduct a pragmatic within-subject pilot trial of a remote Reiki program for frontline healthcare workers' health-related symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: Healthcare professionals in the UK (eg, physicians, nurses, and paramedics) were eligible to sign up for a distance Reiki program and were also invited to participate in the research study. Eight Reiki practitioners simultaneously gave each participant Reiki remotely for 20minutes on 4 consecutive days. Feasibility of the research was assessed, including recruitment, data completeness, acceptability and intervention fidelity, and preliminary evaluation of changes in outcome measures. Participants' stress, anxiety, pain, wellbeing, and sleep quality were evaluated with 7-point numerical rating scales. Measures were completed when signing up to receive Reiki (pre) and following the final Reiki session (post). Pre and post data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed ranks tests.Results: Seventy-nine healthcare professionals signed up to receive Reiki and took the baseline measures. Of those, 40 completed post-measures after the 4-day intervention and were therefore included in the pre-post analysis. Most participants were female (97.5%), and the mean age was 43.9years old (standard deviations = 11.2). The study was feasible to conduct, with satisfactory recruitment, data completeness, acceptability, and fidelity. Wilcoxon signed ranks tests revealed statistically significant decreases in stress (M = -2.33; P < .001), anxiety (M = -2.79; P < .001) and pain (M = -.79; P < .001), and significant increases in wellbeing (M = -1.79; P < .001) and sleep quality (M = -1.33; P = .019).Conclusions: The Reiki program was feasible and was associated with decreased stress, anxiety and pain, and increased wellbeing and sleep quality in frontline healthcare workers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
Predictors of fitness to drive in people with Parkinson disease,"Objective: To develop an efficient clinical screening battery to accurately predict the fitness to drive in people with Parkinson disease ( PD).Methods: This prospective study included 80 participants: 40 patients with PD and 40 healthy age- and sex- matched control subjects. All participants were assessed using a driving simulator, a driving history survey, and the Clinical Dementia Rating. The patients with PD also underwent a clinical test battery and an evaluation of fitness to drive performed by an official center, which included visual, cognitive, and on- road tests. A two- class decision from this driving assessment center was the main outcome measure.Results: A screening battery assessing four clinical variables ( disease duration, contrast sensitivity, Clinical Dementia Rating, and motor part of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) provided the best model ( R-2 = 0.52) to predict the fitness to drive and correctly classified 36 ( 90%) of the patients with PD as pass or fail ( sensitivity = 91%, specificity = 90%). The Test Ride for Investigating Practical fitness to drive ( TRIP) driving simulator score discriminated significantly between drivers with PD and their healthy peers ( p = 0.0008). When the TRIP driving simulator score was added to the clinical model, the total explained variance increased ( R2 = 0.60) and correctly classified 39 ( 97.5%) of drivers with PD into the pass/ fail category ( sensitivity = 91%, specificity = 100%).Conclusions: A short clinical screening battery that measures disease duration, contrast sensitivity, cognitive and motor functions can predict fitness to drive in people with Parkinson disease with a high degree of accuracy.",0
"Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Treatment for Insomnia, Nightmares, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Survivors of Wildfires: Pilot Randomized Feasibility Trial.","BACKGROUND: Symptoms of insomnia, nightmares, and trauma are highly prevalent. However, there are significant barriers to accessing evidence-based treatments for these conditions, leading to poor mental health outcomes.OBJECTIVE: This pilot trial evaluated the feasibility of a 4-week, digital self-paced intervention combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy for nightmares in survivors of wildfires from Australia, Canada, and the United States.METHODS: Study participants were recruited between May 2023 and December 2023 through social media platforms, workshops, conferences, and radio interviews. Participants had to meet at least one of the following criteria: a score of ≥8 on the Insomnia Severity Index, a score of ≥3 on the Nightmare Disorder Index, or a score of ≥31 on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. In total, 30 survivors of wildfires were allocated to either the treatment group (n=16, 53%) or the waitlist control group (n=14, 47%) in a sequential manner. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 79 years, with a mean age of 52.50 (SD 16.26) years. The cohort consisted of 63% (19/30) female and 37% (11/30) male participants. Participants also completed self-report secondary outcome measures, including the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, via the HealthZone digital platform. Assessments were conducted at baseline, the posttreatment time point, and the 3-month follow-up, with the waitlist group undergoing an additional assessment at the pretreatment time point, after 4 weeks of waiting and before crossing over to treatment. This study used intention-to-treat analysis as a primary analysis and per-protocol analysis as a secondary analysis.RESULTS: Mixed-effects linear regression models and difference-in-differences analyses were used to assess the intervention's effects. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed significant improvements over time (main effect of time), with a 1.64-point reduction (P=.001) on the Nightmare Disorder Index and 10.64-point reduction (P=.009) on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 at the postintervention time point. No significant changes were observed in insomnia symptoms. On the secondary measures, there was an interaction effect of condition * time, with a 2.22-point reduction (P<.001) on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and a main effect of time, with a 6.48-point reduction (P<.001) on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. No changes were detected on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. The per-protocol analysis yielded comparable results for both the primary and secondary measures.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot trial demonstrated a reduction in nightmares and trauma symptoms. Future research studies should aim at evaluating the intervention in a more definitive trial with a larger sample size.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12623000415606; https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=385054.",0
Development of a Sleep Monitoring System by Using a Depth Sensor: A Pilot Study,"Sleep is an essential part of health and longevity persons. As people grow older, the quality of their sleep becomes vital. Poor sleep quality can make negative physiological, psychological, and social impacts on the elderly population, causing a range of health problems including coronary heart disease, depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Early detection, proper diagnosis, and treatments for sleep disorders can be achieved by identifying sleep patterns through long-term sleep monitoring. Although many studies developed sleep monitoring systems by using non-invasive measures such as body temperature, pressure, or body movement signal, research is still limited to detect sleep position changes by using a depth camera. The present study is intended (1) to identify concerns on the existing sleep monitoring system based on the literature review and (2) propose to developing a non-invasive sleep monitoring system using an infrared depth camera. For the literature review, various journal/conference papers have been reviewed to understand the characteristics, tools, and algorithms of the existing sleep monitoring systems. For the system development and validation, we collected data for the sleep positions from two subjects (35 years old man and 84 years old women) during the four-hour sleep. Kinect II depth sensor was used for data collection. We found that the averaged depth data is useful measure to notify the participants' positional changes during the sleep.",0
Development and flight test evaluation of a rotor system load monitoring technology,"A neural network based approach for rotor system load monitoring has been developed and evaluated in a flight test of an instrumented SH-60 aircraft. Vibratory loads are predicted using aircraft state parameters which are typically measured and stored on a flight data recorder. The network input parameters are chosen such that the complexity of transmitting signals from the rotating system into the fixed helicopter system is avoided. The load prediction algorithms are developed using an extensive SH-60 flight data set which includes 56 flights and a wide variety of SH-60 usage spectrum maneuvers. The real-time load monitoring capability was demonstrated in a flight test evaluation where the algorithms were embedded in an on-board processor and executed in real time. Network predictions are compared with rotor system strain gauge measurements from the flight test aircraft. Assessment of the load predictions shows good results and indicates that the neural network algorithms, developed using flight data from one aircraft, can be used to predict vibratory loads on a second aircraft of the same class. The flight test results also demonstrate the potential to use the algorithms for real-time pilot cueing to minimize operation in fatigue damaging flight conditions.",0
Driving Under the Influence of Amphetamine-Like Drugs,"Scientific opinions differ whether the use of stimulants causes deterioration in driving skills. In 1857 of 8709 cases of driving under the influence of drugs, amphetamine-like drugs (amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methylendioxyamphetamine) were present either alone or together with other licit or illicit drugs. In 338 cases, amphetamines were the only psychoactive substance group in plasma at mean, median, and highest concentrations of 0.18, 0.12, and 1.05 mg/L, respectively. A widespread opinion is that after the consumption of amphetamines, centrally stimulating effects with corresponding consequences on safe driving are expected. In contrast, many cases were observed that rather suggested an influence of centrally sedating substances when considering the psycho-physical conditions. Relations between concentration and effect could not be established. The apparent sedation is probably the consequence of sleep deprivation during an amphetamine binge and the after-effects of the drug.",0
Manufacturing Operator Ergonomics: A Conceptual Digital Twin Approach to Detect Biomechanical Fatigue,"The primary sources of injuries in the workplace are improper manual material handling (MMH) motions, forklift collisions, slip, and fall. This research presents a Digital Twin (DT) framework to analyze fatigue in humans while performing lifting MMH activity in a laboratory environment for the purpose of reducing these types of injuries. The proposed methodology analyzes the worker's body joints to detect biomechanical fatigue as a factor of change in back, elbow, and knee joint angles. Using the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm, the change in joint angles with time was analyzed. The variation in DTW parameters was evaluated using exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts for further analysis. A preliminary study considering two healthy male subjects performing seven experiments, each under an optical motion capture system was performed to test the model's efficiency. Our contributions are twofold. First, we propose a model to detect biomechanical fatigue in the subjects performing MMH lifting activity as a change in joint angles. Secondly, the research also shows evidence that different individuals show signs of body fatigue via different body joints and showcases the need for a true personalized DT for an operator for fatigue assessment in an MMH environment.",0
Driver assistance systems aim to halve traffic accidents,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reveal how technology is being applied to augment drivers' skills and improve road safety throughout Europe.Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with a description of the European Commission's car safety initiatives, and why they are necessary. Then three driver-assistance systems are examined in detail: adaptive cruise control, lane departure and lane-changing systems, and driver vigilance monitoring.Findings - Radar, lidar, and imaging sensors are being used and sometimes fused to build highly intelligent driver assistance equipment. The response of the system is crucial to its acceptance and success: false alarms or over-violent actuation would lead to rejection. Neither must the system encourage over-confidence. It is estimated that drowsiness detection could prevent 30 per cent of fatal motorway crashes.Originality/value - The paper alerts engineers and drivers to a long-term Europe-wide project to develop and deploy driver assistance technologies.",1
Driver Behavior Analysis for Safe Driving: A Survey,"Driver drowsiness and distraction are two main reasons for traffic accidents and the related financial losses. Therefore, researchers have been working for more than a decade on designing driver inattention monitoring systems. As a result, several detection techniques for the detection of both drowsiness and distraction have been proposed in the literature. Some of these techniques were successfully adopted and implemented by the leading car companies. This paper discusses and provides a comprehensive insight into the well-established techniques for driver inattention monitoring and introduces the use of most recent and futuristic solutions exploiting mobile technologies such as smartphones and wearable devices. Then, a proposal is made for the active of such systems into car-to-car communication to support vehicular ad hoc network's (VANET's) primary aim of safe driving. We call this approach the dissemination of driver behavior via C2C communication. Throughout this paper, the most remarkable studies of the last five years were examined thoroughly in order to reveal the recent driver monitoring techniques and demonstrate the basic pros and cons. In addition, the studies were categorized into two groups: driver drowsiness and distraction. Then, research on the driver drowsiness was further divided into two main subgroups based on the exploitation of either visual features or nonvisual features. A comprehensive compilation, including used features, classification methods, accuracy rates, system parameters, and environmental details, was represented as tables to highlight the (dis) advantages and/or limitations of the aforementioned categories. A similar approach was also taken for the methods used for the detection of driver distraction.",0
DrowsyDetectNet: Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Lightweight CNN With Limited Training Data,"One major factor in the rising incidence of traffic accidents is the driver's drowsiness. Innovations in computer vision technology have made it possible to construct smart cams that can recognize driver fatigue. By alerting drivers, this technology successfully lowers the total number of accidents caused by weariness. This study proposes a DrowsyDetectNet that utilizes a shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to identify driver drowsiness. The 68-point face landmark identification approach is used to identify faces and extract eye areas. The proposed system employs a shallow CNN architecture with fewer layers and parameters to detect driver drowsiness with limited training data. Feature extraction focuses on relevant visual cues for drowsiness detection, such as eyelid closure. The transfer learning models, such as VGG19, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, are also used to identify driver drowsiness. Two datasets, Dataset-1 and Dataset-2, were utilized to assess this study. On two datasets, the proposed DrowsyDetectNet produced an accuracy of 99.23% and 99.14%, respectively. The proposed DrowsyDetctNet framework achieved better accuracy when compared with state-of-the-art models and pre-trained models.",1
Breaking the ice: a work domain analysis of icebreaker operations,"Icebreakers are special-purpose ships designed to operate in different ice-covered waters, either independently or during assistance of weaker ships. In the Baltic Sea, as well as elsewhere, they are essential for maintaining continuous sea transport services during wintertime. Icebreaker operations are complex, and every situation in which a vessel requires assistance is unique, due to, e.g. changing ice and weather conditions, geographical location or language proficiency of the crew on board the icebreaker or assisted vessel. The icebreaker crew has considerable freedom to adapt to each situation, yet, for safe operations, there are constraints to which the crew has to conform. The study presented in this paper aims at identifying the constraints on nautical officers on board icebreakers during operations, as well as special situations that increase cognitive load. A work domain analysis based on a group interview with nautical icebreaker officers shows the multitude of tasks performed on board icebreakers. Furthermore, it identifies constraints specific to icebreaker operations such as ice assessment and direct icebreaking, but also generic constraints such as language and communication skills. At times, safety and efficiency come into conflict, resulting in a trade-off between the two. When that happens, safety gets priority, and the operation stops until the situation has been evaluated. In addition, several situations that increase cognitive load are identified, with the common denominator that they add elements of uncertainty, e.g. severe weather and technical malfunctions. Finally, further research within the area of icebreaker operations is recommended, with a continued focus on the system constraints, and their potential for system improvement.",0
Biocompatible Film-Coating of Magnetic Soft Robots for Mucoadhesive Locomotion,"Magnetically-actuated soft robots for medical applications are required to be functional, biocompatible, as well as capable of robust motion inside human organs. In this paper, a ring-shaped magnetic soft robot, with a flexible biopolymeric film coating, capable of motion on mucus-coated surfaces is designed and investigated. The biopolymeric film made from chitosan-glycerol (C-G) solution endows the robot with robust locomotion capabilities on surfaces of diverse geometrical shapes and orientations. By utilizing mucoadhesive locomotion, the robot has the potential to carry out clinical procedures on enclosed mucus-coated tissue surfaces. Material characterization shows that the mucoadhesion increases with the increase of contact times and/or preload forces. The softness of the C-G film can be adjusted by controlling the concentration of glycerol. The ring-shaped design and magnetization profile decouple the locomotion and functions of the robot. Additionally, the C-G film-coated robot is tested to be biocompatible for a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line with epithelial morphology (HT29). The C-G film reduces the negative effects (superoxide generation) of ferromagnetic particles. Three robot functions including pick-and-place, cargo transportation, and liquid capsule release are demonstrated on different surfaces to show the maneuverability, functionality, and potential of implementing clinical procedures through mucoadhesion.",0
Evaluation of the fatigue-related influence of start-ups on Pelton turbines based on reduced scale model stress measurements,"In recent decades, the electricity industry has undergone a significant transformation from a vertically integrated supply system to a market-regulated structure. This shift, along with the intermittent nature of increasingly prevalent non-dispatchable renewable energy sources, induces system operators to redistribute portions of the power generation included in the market schedule to preserve the energy balance within the power system. For hydropower plants, this translates in increasingly frequent operations in transient condition, with significant fatigue-related consequences on the lifetime of hydraulic machines. The understanding of fatigue phenomena during transient operations requires therefore experimental investigations, modeling and optimization of such operations, representing today a relevant research subject. This paper proposes the comparison between two methodologies which aim to estimate and optimize the operational cost, with respect to the lifetime of a Pelton turbine, of the specific case of the back-to-back start-up of a multistage pump performed with the Pelton runner of the same ternary group. These methodologies are developed on data collected during an experimental campaign performed with the reduced scale model of the investigated turbine, homologous to the real test case pumped-storage power plant. Despite the substantial distinction in the adopted approaches, the two methodologies show common features in terms of the fatigue damage trend as a function of the turbine operating conditions, and of the optimal strategy minimizing the structural impact of start-up sequences.",0
VIGNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for EEG-based Driver Vigilance Estimation,"Estimating driver fatigue is an important issue for traffic safety and user-centered brain-computer interface. In this paper, based on differential entropy (DE) extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) signals, we develop a novel deep convolutional neural network to detect driver drowsiness. By exploiting DE of EEG samples, the proposed network effectively extracts class-discriminative deep and hierarchical features. Then, a densely-connected layer is used for the final decision making to identify driver condition. To demonstrate the validity of our proposed method, we conduct classification and regression experiments using publicly available SEED-VIG dataset. Further, we also compare the proposed network to other competitive state-of-the-art methods with an appropriate statistical analysis. Furthermore, we inspect the real-world usability of our method by visualizing a change in the probability of driver status and confusion matrices.",1
Mobile App-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia: Feasibility and Initial Efficacy Among Veterans With Cannabis Use Disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit substance in the United States resulting in high rates of cannabis use disorders. Current treatments for cannabis use are often met with high rates of lapse/relapse, tied to (1) behavioral health factors that impact cannabis use such as poor sleep, and (2) access, stigma, supply, and cost of receiving a substance use intervention.OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examined the feasibility, usability, and changes in cannabis use and sleep difficulties following mobile phone-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in the context of a cannabis cessation attempt.METHODS: Four male veterans with DSM-5 cannabis use disorder and sleep problems were randomized to receive a 2-week intervention: CBT-I Coach mobile app (n=2) or a placebo control (mood-tracking app) (n=2). Cannabis and sleep measures were assessed pre- and post-treatment. Participants also reported use and helpfulness of each app. Changes in sleep and cannabis use were evaluated for each participant individually.RESULTS: Both participants receiving CBT-I used the app daily over 2 weeks and found the app user-friendly, helpful, and would use it in the future. In addition, they reported decreased cannabis use and improved sleep efficiency; one also reported increased sleep quality. In contrast, one participant in the control group dropped out of the study, and the other used the app minimally and reported increased sleep quality but also increased cannabis use. The mood app was rated as not helpful, and there was low likelihood of future participation.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study examined the feasibility and initial patient acceptance of mobile phone delivery of CBT-I for cannabis dependence. Positive ratings of the app and preliminary reports of reductions in cannabis use and improvements in sleep are both encouraging and support additional evaluation of this intervention.",0
A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Post-stroke Fatigue. The Nor-COAST study,"Objective: This study aimed to predict fatigue 18 months post -stroke by utilizing comprehensive data from the acute and sub -acute phases after stroke in a machine -learning set-up. Design: A prospective multicenter cohort -study with 18 -month follow-up. Setting: Outpatient clinics at 3 university hospitals and 2 local hospitals. Participants: 474 participants with the diagnosis of acute stroke (mean SD age; 70.5 (11.3), 59% male; N=474). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome, fatigue at 18 months, was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS-7). FSS-7 >= 5 was defined as fatigue. In total, 45 prediction variables were collected, at initial hospital -stay and 3 -month post -stroke. Results: The best performing model, random forest, predicted 69% of all subjects with fatigue correctly with a sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.86), a specificity of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.83), and an Area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.87) in new unseen data. The proportion of subjects predicted to suffer from fatigue, who truly suffered from fatigue at 18 -months was estimated to 0.41 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.57). The proportion of subjects predicted to be free from fatigue who truly did not have fatigue at 18 -months was estimated to 0.90 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.96). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the model has satisfactory ability to predict fatigue in the chronic phase post -stroke and may be applicable in clinical settings.

SIMPLifying Urology Residency Operative Assessments: A Pilot Study in Urology Training,"Purpose: The Society for Improving Medical Professional Learning (SIMPL) app is an innovative, convenient and validated smartphone-based tool to evaluate residents' operative performance. In this study, we describe the initial implementation of SIMPL in our program's pediatric urology rotationdthe first among urology residencies-and provide preliminary data on its adoption by residents and faculty.Materials and Methods: Residents and faculty in our pediatric urology division submitted SIMPL evaluations following surgical cases from August 2019 to July 2020. Evaluations consisted of ratings in 3 domains: resident autonomy, resident operative performance and patient-related case complexity. An online survey was also used to gauge attitudes towards SIMPL, describe patterns of use and solicit feedback on areas for improvement.Results: Eight residents and 6 faculty submitted 141 evaluations, with 76.6% of evaluated cases having both faculty and resident ratings. Verbal feedback was included in 94.2%. Faculty-resident agreement ranged from 68.6% to 75.2% (kappa=0.47 to 0.61). Faculty rated postgraduate year (PGY)-4 residents as more autonomous (p=0.040) and higher performing (p=0.028) than PGY-3 residents. All participants agreed that SIMPL was easy to use and compared favorably to existing avenues of feedback. Barriers to implementation included lack of reminders for evaluations and evaluation fatigue.Conclusions: The SIMPL application improved both frequency and quality of resident operative feedback. Among participants, SIMPL was preferred over the existing feedback system at our institution.",0
The Effects of Quetiapine on Sleep in Recovering Alcohol-Dependent Subjects A Pilot Study,"Objective The aim of this hypothesis-generating pilot study was to assess prospectively the objective and subjective effects of treatment with quetiapine XR on sleep during early recovery from alcohol dependence (AD).Methods Recovering subjects with AD and sleep disturbance complaints were treated with quetiapine XR (n = 10) or matching placebo pills (n = 10) for 8 weeks. Polysomnography was used to assess sleep objectively, and the Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to measure subjective insomnia. Other assessment measures included the 10-minute psychomotor vigilance task (for neurobehavioral functioning), the time-line follow-back measure (for alcohol consumption), the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (for alcohol craving), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item scale (for depressive symptoms), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (for anxiety symptoms).Results Although there was no effect of quetiapine XR on sleep efficiency (time spent asleep/total recording time), there was a pre-to-post reduction in wake after sleep onset time (P = 0.03) and nonsignificant trends for increases in sleep onset latency (SOL) and stage 2 sleep time. A time x drug interaction was seen for the subjective insomnia, such that quetiapine XR-treated subjects reported greater initial improvement in their subjective insomnia, but the difference was not sustained. There were no differences between treatment groups on other measures or medication compliance.Conclusion Quetiapine XR improves objective sleep continuity and transiently improves subjective insomnia early in recovery from AD.",0
Assessment of dynamic balance via measurement of lower extremities tortuosity,"Tortuosity describes how twisted or how much curvature is present in an observed movement or path. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in segmental tortuosity between Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) reach directions. Fifteen healthy participants completed this study. Participants completed the modified three direction (anterior, posteromedial, posterolateral) SEBT with three-dimensional motion analysis using an 8 camera BTS Smart 7000DX motion analysis system. The tortuosity of stance limb retro-reflective markers was then calculated and compared between reach directions using a 1x3 ANOVA with repeated measures, while the relationship between SEBT performance and tortuosity was established using Pearson product moment correlations. Anterior superior iliac spine tortuosity was significantly greater (p<0.001) and lateral knee tortuosity was lesser (p=0.018) in the anterior direction compared to the posteromedial and posterolateral directions. In addition, second metatarsal tortuosity was greater in the anterior reach direction when compared to posteromedial direction (p=0.024). Tortuosity is a novel biomechanical measurement technique that provides an assessment of segmental movement during common dynamic tasks such as the SEBT. This enhanced level of detail compared to more global measures of joint kinematic may provide insight into compensatory movement strategies adopted following lower extremity joint injury.",0
Wireless Monitoring Program of Patient-Centered Outcomes and Recovery Before and After Major Abdominal Cancer Surgery,"IMPORTANCE A combined subjective and objective wireless monitoring program of patient-centered outcomes can be carried out in patients before and after major abdominal cancer surgery.OBJECTIVE To conduct a proof-of-concept pilot study of a wireless, patient-centered outcomes monitoring program before and after major abdominal cancer surgery.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this proof-of-concept pilot study, patients wore wristband pedometers and completed online patient-reported outcome surveys (symptoms and quality of life) 3 to 7 days before surgery, during hospitalization, and up to 2 weeks after discharge. Reminders via email were generated for all moderate to severe scores for symptoms and quality of life. Surgery-related data were collected via electronic medical records, and complications were calculated using the Clavien-Dindo classification. The study was carried out in the inpatient and outpatient surgical oncology unit of one National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. Eligible patients were scheduled to undergo curative resection for hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal cancers, were English speaking, and were 18 years or older. Twenty participants were enrolled over 4 months. The study dates were April 1, 2015, to July 31, 2016.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes included adherence to wearing the pedometer, adherence to completing the surveys (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and EuroQol 5-dimensional descriptive system), and satisfaction with the monitoring program.RESULTS This study included a final sample of 20 patients (median age, 55.5 years [range, 22-74 years]; 15 [75%] female) with evaluable data. Pedometer adherence (88%[17 of 20] before surgery vs 83%[16 of 20] after discharge) was higher than survey adherence (65% to 75%[13 of 20 and 15 of 20] completed). The median number of daily steps at day 7 was 1689 (19% of daily steps at baseline), which correlated with the Comprehensive Complication Index, for which the median was 15 of 100 (r = -0.64, P < .05). Postdischarge overall symptom severity (2.3 of 10) and symptom interference with activities (3.5 of 10) were mild. Pain (4.4 of 10), fatigue (4.7 of 10), and appetite loss (4.0 of 10) were moderate after surgery. Quality-of-life scores were lowest at discharge (66.6 of 100) but improved at week 2 (73.9 of 100). While patient-reported outcomes returned to baseline at 2 weeks, the number of daily steps was only one-third of preoperative baseline.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Wireless monitoring of combined subjective and objective patient-centered outcomes can be carried out in the surgical oncology setting. Preoperative and postoperative patient-centered outcomes have the potential of identifying high-risk populations who may need additional interventions to support postoperative functional and symptom recovery.",0
Interventions to evaluate fitness to drive among people with chronic conditions: Systematic review of literature,"When an health condition has been identified, the question of whether to continue driving depends not on a medical diagnosis, but on the functional consequences of the illness. The complex nature of physical and mental impairments and their relationship with safe driving make the availability of evidence based tools necessary for health professionals.The review aims at identifying and summarizing scientific findings concerning the relationship between neuropsychological and clinical screening tests and fitness to drive among people with chronic conditions.Studies were searched for driving ability evaluation by road test or simulator, clinical/neuropsychological examinations of participants with chronic diseases or permanent disablement impairing driving performance, primary outcomes as fatal/non-fatal traffic injuries and secondary outcomes as fitness to drive assessment.Twenty-seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Some studies included more than one clinical condition. The illness investigated were Alzheimer Disease (n = 6), Parkinson Disease (n = 8), Cardiovascular Accident (n = 4), Traumatic Brain Injuries (n = 3), Sleep Apnea Syndrome (n = 2), Narcolepsy (n = 1), Multiple Sclerosis (n = 1) and Hepatic Encephalopathy (n = 1). comorbidities (n = 3). No studies match inclusion criteria about Myasthenia Gravis, Diabetes Mellitus, Renal Diseases, Hearing Disorders and Sight Diseases. No studies referred to primary outcomes.The selected studies provided opposite evidences. It would be reasonable to argue that some clinical and neuropsychological tests are effective in predicting fitness to drive even if contrasting results support that driving performance decreases as a function of clinical and neuropsychological decline in some chronic diseases. Nevertheless we found no evidence that clinical and neuropsychological screening tests would lead to a reduction in motor vehicle crashes involving chronic disabled drivers.It seems necessary to develop tests with proven validity for identifying high-risk drivers so that physicians can provide guidance to their patients in chronic conditions, and also to medical advisory boards working with licensing offices.

Video-Computer Technology of Real Time Vehicle Driver Fatigue Monitoring,"This article is devoted to the actual problem of human fatigue control and attention concentration reduction in transport. The authors consider the most efficient, by their mind, method of person psycho-emotional condition assessment that is video control based on eye condition analysis. It is based on a convolutional neural network having its own topology. The problem of network optimal depth choosing to operate in real-time mode, and the problem of large accuracy indicators on a single-board ARM processor architecture computer were analyzed. As a research result, the software and hardware complex prototype was presented. This prototype allows to detect human fatigue by means of eye video image analysis. This system allows to reduce number of car accidents associated with vehicle driver falling asleep. In conclusion, the short-term project development prospects are proposed. Fatigue of the person who makes control, management or decision-making, and decrease of attention concentration on object can lead to critical consequences. The most efficient person physiological state control is video control based on eye condition analysis. The algorithm based on convolutional neural network and its hardware implementation, providing face search in the image, eye detection and analysis of eye condition by open-closed principle is proposed.",1
A System For Drivers' Cognitive Load Estimation Based On Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Facial Feature Analysis,"The driver's cognitive load estimation on the road is a critical factor for safety measurement that can reduce the overall number of road accidents. Factors such as distraction from driving, being lost in thought, conversation, cell phone use, and drowsiness, can be used to compute a driver's attention level on driving. To minimize the number of fatal and critical circumstances on the road, this work investigates a decision tree-based deep-learning algorithm focusing on the estimation of the driver's cognitive load. We construct and evaluate the performance of multimodal deep learning approaches, which combine two separately trained ResNet50 convolutional neural networks on data acquired from the driver's side and front face images. Further, we compare two different approaches for driver drowsiness level estimation using different computer vision algorithms. The first approach is implemented via the blinking ratio method using 68-landmarks of the face by calculating the blinking and yawning ratio. In contrast, the second one uses the contour area approach for drowsiness identification using morphological operations. As differences between driver behavioral classes are more distinct from side camera images than from the frontal image, the former has been chosen to be used for deep learning classification, and eventually, the accuracy of 92% has been achieved. On the other hand, the frontal image was successfully used to robustly detect the driver's drowsiness level by using computer vision techniques on facial landmarks. As a result, the decision tree was constructed to estimate the driver's driving safety level based on deep learning side posture classification and blinking ratio methods.",1
Is chronic fatigue the symptom of venous insufficiency associated with multiple sclerosis? A longitudinal pilot study,"Aim. Chronic fatigue (CF) severely affects patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), but its pathogenesis remains elusive and the effectiveness of available treatments is modest. We aimed to evaluate the effect on CF of the balloon dilatation of stenosing lesions affecting the main extracranial veins configuring the chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), a condition strongly associated with MS.Methods. Thirty-one MS consecutive patients (16 males, age 46.2 +/- 9.4 years) with associated CCSVI and CF underwent the endovascular procedure. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) at baseline (TO) and one (T1), six (T6) and twelve (T12) months after the procedure. In ambulatory patients (N.=28), mobility was evaluated using the 6-min walking test at T0 and T1.Results. FSS and MFIS scores significantly improved from preoperative values, and the positive trend was maintained at one year (FSS: T0=5.1 +/- 1.0 to T12=3.5 +/- 1.8, P<0.001; MFIS-total score: T0=34.9 +/- 14.8 to T12=22.5 +/- 13.7, P<).001; MFIS-Physical subscale: T0=21.2 +/- 8.0 to T12=13.5 +/- 9.7 P<0.001; MFIS-Cognitive subscale: T0=9.2 +/- 9.5 to T12=6.0 +/- 6.3, P=0.03; MFIS-Psychosocial subscale: T0=4.5 +/- 2.1 to T12=2.5 +/- 2.1, P<0.001). Six-min walking distance (6MWD) at T1 improved significantly (332 +/- 190m to 378 +/- 200m, P=0.0002). In addition, an inverted correlation between 6MWD and MFIS-physical subscale variations was found in the subgroup of patients (N.=8) with no lower limb motor impairment (r=-0.74, P=0.035).Conclusion. The reestablishment of cerebral venous return dramatically reduced CF perception in a group of MS patients with associated CCSVI, suggesting that CF is likely the symptom of CCSVI.

INCEFA-SCALE (INCREASING SAFETY IN NPPS BY COVERING GAPS IN ENVIRONMENTAL FATIGUE ASSESSMENT - FOCUSING ON GAPS BETWEEN LABORATORY DATA AND COMPONENT-SCALE),"INCEFA-SCALE is a five-year project supported by the European Commission HORIZON2020 programme. It is the successor to the INCEFA-PLUS programme that ran from 2015 to 2020. INCEFA-SCALE kicked off in September 2020. The objective is to continue work, advancing the ability to predict lifetimes of Nuclear Plant components when subjected to Environmental Assisted Fatigue loading (EAF).It has been generally observed by nuclear plant operators that there appears to be a disconnect between the perceived difficulty of providing an acceptable assessment result with the current EAF methodologies and the good service experience with regard to this specific degradation mechanism. It is internationally recognised that a possible contributor to this discrepancy is the transferability of laboratory-scale tests to real nuclear components. EPRI, in the USA, is leading a series of component-scale environmental fatigue tests that are expected to advance data availability significantly; however, the ability to address transferability of laboratory-scale tests to real component geometries and loadings will still be constrained by limited test data. This is the knowledge gap addressed by INCEFA-SCALE. The project strategy will be (1) the development of comprehensive mechanistic understanding developed through detailed examination of test specimens and MatDB datamining, and (2) testing focussed on particular aspects of component-scale cyclic loading. The project will initially survey and understand the vast amount of test data within JRC's MatDB database (from the predecessor INCEFA-PLUS project, and from other external sources such as USNRC, EPRI, MHI and the AdFaM project). In parallel, the test programme needs have been agreed, and protocols agreed for managing data, testing, and material examinations consistently. Testing commenced after one year and will run for three years. Finally, the project will deliver guidance on the use of laboratory-scale data for component-scale applications.This paper will report the first year of the project and detail the preparations completed to ensure the project maximises the achievement of its objectives.",0
Driver fatigue through nightshifts in succession,"Coal Services (Health and Safety Trust) funded ARRB Transport Research Ltd to investigate fatigue and performance of truck drivers over consecutive shifts. The main questions were to assess: What is the most important contributor to acute fatigue in mining? Is it length of shift (eg eight hours versus 12 hours) or is it time of day (eg circadian effects)? What is the limit of successive day or night shifts before chronic fatigue affects operator performance in open cut mines? The project methodology included utilising ARRB Fatigue Monitoring Devices (forced-choice stimulus reaction) in eight haul trucks, testing 24 subjects over several weeks. Each subject filled in a Fatigue Risk Questionnaire on lifestyle and health. Operators worked a 14-night, one day off, 13-day roster of 12-hour shifts in a fly-in/fly-out operation with excellent opportunities for restorative sleep between shifts. A total of 3500 hours of real-time data was collected, representing the first set of objective, real-time driver performance data for Australian mining.The data showed that for a single night of driving haul trucks, there appears to be no effect on operator fatigue from the amount of time on task (for the 12 hours). In fact performance was worse through the first eight hours than the last four. The circadian influence had a stronger affect than working more than eight hours. Of the 14 nights worked at the site, nights 13, 14, seven and two respectively, were the worst. This presents a conundrum for policy makers who may like to place caps on working hours or rosters in the hope that it will alleviate the fatigue issue. It will not. The major finding within this study is the combined influence of circadian rhythms (human body clock) and individual variability on performance. The lifestyle habits and the health of individuals have a profound effect on operator performance as shown by the strong positive correlation between high fatigue risk scores from the Fatigue Risk Questionnaire and poor performance. An individualistic approach would appear to have the best chance of reducing high potential incidents due to fatigue through successive nightshifts.",1
Crash risk perception of sleepy driving and its comparisons with drink driving and speeding: Which behavior is perceived as the riskiest?,"Objective: Driver sleepiness is a major crash risk factor but may be underrecognized as a risky driving behavior. Sleepy driving is usually rated as less of a road safety issue than more well-known risky driving behaviors, such as drink driving and speeding. The objective of this study was to compare perception of crash risk of sleepy driving, drink driving, and speeding.Methods: Three hundred Australian drivers completed a questionnaire that assessed crash risk perceptions for sleepy driving, drink driving, and speeding. Additionally, the participants' perceptions of crash risk were assessed for 5 different contextual scenarios that included different levels of sleepiness (low, high), driving duration (short, long), and time of day/circadian influences (afternoon, nighttime) of driving.Results: The analysis confirmed that sleepy driving was considered a risky driving behavior but not as risky as high levels of speeding (P < .05). Yet, the risk of crashing at 4 a.m. was considered as equally risky as low levels of speeding (10 km over the limit). The comparisons of the contextual scenarios revealed driving scenarios that would arguably be perceived as quite risky because time of day/circadian influences were not reported as high risk.Conclusions: The results suggest a lack of awareness or appreciation of circadian rhythm functioning, particularly the descending phase of circadian rhythm that promotes increased sleepiness in the afternoon and during the early hours of the morning. Yet, the results suggested an appreciation of the danger associated with long-distance driving and driver sleepiness. Further efforts are required to improve the community's awareness of the impairing effects from sleepiness and, in particular, knowledge regarding the human circadian rhythm and the increased sleep propensity during the circadian nadir.",0
EEG-Based Driving Fatigue Detection Using a Two-Level Learning Hierarchy Radial Basis Function,"Electroencephalography (EEG)-based driving fatigue detection has gained increasing attention recently due to the non-invasive, low-cost, and potable nature of the EEG technology, but it is still challenging to extract informative features from noisy EEG signals for driving fatigue detection. Radial basis function (RBF) neural network has drawn lots of attention as a promising classifier due to its linear-in-the-parameters network structure, strong non-linear approximation ability, and desired generalization property. The RBF network performance heavily relies on network parameters such as the number of the hidden nodes, number of the center vectors, width, and output weights. However, global optimization methods that directly optimize all the network parameters often result in high evaluation cost and slow convergence. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of EEG-based driving fatigue detection model, this study aims to develop a two-level learning hierarchy RBF network (RBF-TLLH) which allows for global optimization of the key network parameters. Experimental EEG data were collected, at both fatigue and alert states, from six healthy participants in a simulated driving environment. Principal component analysis was first utilized to extract features from EEG signals, and the proposed RBF-TLLH was then employed for driving status (fatigue vs. alert) classification. The results demonstrated that the proposed RBF-TLLH approach achieved a better classification performance (mean accuracy: 92.71%; area under the receiver operating curve: 0.9199) compared to other widely used artificial neural networks. Moreover, only three core parameters need to be determined using the training datasets in the proposed RBF-TLLH classifier, which increases its reliability and applicability. The findings demonstrate that the proposed RBF-TLLH approach can be used as a promising framework for reliable EEG-based driving fatigue detection.",1
A sophisticated Drowsiness Detection System via Deep Transfer Learning for real time scenarios,"Driver drowsiness is one of the leading causes of road accidents resulting in serious physical injuries, fatalities, and substantial economic losses. A sophisticated Driver Drowsiness Detection (DDD) system can alert the driver in case of abnormal behavior and avoid catastrophes. Several studies have already addressed driver drowsiness through behavioral measures and facial features. In this paper, we propose a hybrid real-time DDD system based on the Eyes Closure Ratio and Mouth Opening Ratio using simple camera and deep learning techniques. This system seeks to model the driver's behavior in order to alert him/her in case of drowsiness states to avoid potential accidents. The main contribution of the proposed approach is to build a reliable system able to avoid false detected drowsiness situations and to alert only the real ones. To this end, our research procedure is divided into two processes. The offline process performs a classification module using pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect the drowsiness of the driver. In the online process, we calculate the percentage of the eyes' closure and yawning frequency of the driver online from real-time video using the Chebyshev distance instead of the classic Euclidean distance. The accurate drowsiness state of the driver is evaluated with the aid of the pretrained CNNs based on an ensemble learning paradigm. In order to improve models' performances, we applied data augmentation techniques for the generated dataset. The accuracies achieved are 97 % for the VGG16 model, 96% for VGG19 model and 98% for ResNet50 model. This system can assess the driver's dynamics with a precision rate of 98%.",1
A focus on quantitative methods to assess human factors in collaborative robotics,"The advent of Industry 4.0 has transformed manufacturing by incorporating industrial robots to boost productivity and quality while cutting costs. Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) is central to this shift, emphasizing seamless cooperation between humans and robots in shared workspaces. Evaluating the impact of such collaboration on human operators is crucial for efficiency, safety, and well-being. This systematic review explores methodologies for assessing human factors in HRC environments, spanning psychological, cognitive, and physical realms. Various evaluation methods have been identified, from subjective questionnaires to objective measurements. While subjective methods are the standard (especially questionnaires), there is a growing trend towards integrating physiological and physical measurements. The blend of subjective and objective methods offers a holistic understanding of human-robot interaction. This review adopts a more technical-oriented approach in the assessment of human factors in HRC. As a result, it consolidates existing methodologies and suggests avenues for further research, highlighting the significance of this assessment for enhancing productivity, safety, and well-being in industrial settings.",0
3D-CNN Method for Drowsy Driving Detection Based on Driving Pattern Recognition,"Drowsiness impairs drivers' concentration and reaction time, doubling the risk of car accidents. Various methods for detecting drowsy driving have been proposed that rely on facial changes. However, they have poor detection for drivers wearing a mask or sunglasses, and they do not reflect the driver's drowsiness habits. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method to detect drowsy driving even with facial detection obstructions, such as masks or sunglasses, and regardless of the driver's different drowsiness habits, by recognizing behavioral patterns. We achieve this by constructing both normal driving and drowsy driving datasets and developing a 3D-CNN (3D Convolutional Neural Network) model reflecting the Inception structure of GoogleNet. This binary classification model classifies normal driving and drowsy driving videos. Using actual videos captured inside real vehicles, this model achieved a classification accuracy of 85% for detecting drowsy driving without facial obstructions and 75% for detecting drowsy driving when masks and sunglasses are worn. Our results demonstrate that the behavioral pattern recognition method is effective in detecting drowsy driving.",1
Recurrent error pathways in HFACS data: Analysis of 95 mishaps with remotely piloted aircraft,"Background: According to Reason's model of accident causation, mishaps tend to fall into recurrent patterns. This model is the foundation for the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), which is now widely used in aviation accident analysis. The purpose of this study was to determine if it was possible to use HFACS to identify recurrent error pathways within an existing mishap database. Methods: All MQ-1 Predator remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) mishaps and safety incidents reported to the Air Force Safety Center during fiscal years 19972005 were evaluated and entered into a mishap database (N = 95). An exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the factorial structure within the set of crewmember-related mishaps (N = 48). The results of the PCA were used to define recurrent pathways from latent to active failure and hence mishaps. A tree diagram was subsequently created to quantitatively assess the associations identified in the PCA. Results: Four factors were identified, each consisting of one of the HFACS categories of active failure and one or more categories of latent failure. Two additional factors were identified, consisting of fatigue and motivational latent failures. Based on analysis of the tree diagram, the majority of mishaps were caused by latent failures involving organizational factors and the technological environment. Conclusions: it was possible to identify four recurrent error pathways associated with the four types of HFACS active failures within this sample of RPA mishaps. Two of these error pathways, accounting for 57% of crewmember-related mishaps, were consistent with situation awareness errors associated with perception of the environment.",0
Shoulder-Sidewinder (Shoulder-Side Wearable Industrial Ergonomic Robot): Design and Evaluation of Shoulder Wearable Robot With Mechanisms to Compensate for Joint Misalignment,"Shoulder-sidewinder is an exoskeleton to assist the shoulder movement of workers performing manual tasks. It aims to minimize discomfort caused by a joint misalignment between the shoulder and an exoskeleton, which is a common problem with many closely coupled systems. Based on the shoulder's musculoskeletal structure, we propose two novel misalignment correction mechanisms: center-of-rotation tracking mechanism and force-guiding mechanism. The center-of-rotation tracking mechanism compensates for the vertical misalignment that arises from the scapulohumeral rhythm. The force-guiding mechanism compensates for the horizontal misalignment due to changes in the plane of the arm elevation. The kinematic performance of reducing joint misalignment was evaluated using the angle ratio as the indicator under two conditions: with and without the center-of-rotation tracking mechanism. The muscle load caused by the kinematic disturbance was evaluated under three conditions: wearing the exoskeleton with and without the center-of-rotation tracking mechanism and not wearing the exoskeleton. The analysis used muscle load data measured by surface electromyography on five shoulder muscles. Five subjects executed 12 arm motions each, in 4 planes of elevation. Since the system was optimized for a pilot user, subjects with similar morphology presented positive results showing that the proposed mechanism reduced the misalignment in the dominant range of working motion. Apart from the anterior deltoid, the loads on muscles responsible for the dominant range of working motion also showed a significant reduction compared to the case without the mechanism. In conclusion, we verified that the shoulder-sidewinder provides comfortable support by reducing joint misalignment, and identified directions for design improvements that will further enhance usability.",0
Advanced Driver Assistance System for the drowsiness detection using facial landmarks,"This paper presents the development of a solution to detect a driver's drowsiness in real time and issue alerts to avoid possible traffic accidents.

Distraction, drowsiness, tiredness, speeding and fatigue are the main causes of accidents and, precisely, advanced driver assistance systems ADAS help reduce these serious human errors.",1
A Novel Spiral Capsule Robot with Liquid Drug Releasing Functions,"In the field of gastrointestinal and gastrointestinal diseases, the most common detection method is to use a digestive endoscope, but because the gastroscope passes through the human pharynx, it causes irritation to the pharynx, and patients will have discomfort such as nausea; after the colonoscopy enters the intestinal cavity, the patient will feel abdominal pain. To solve these problems, researchers invented capsule endoscopes. At present, after the capsule endoscope used in the clinic is swallowed by the human body, it is moved by the peristalsis of the intestine, and the internal image is transmitted to the outside world through wireless communication for diagnosis by the doctor, and finally discharged from the human anus, with low efficiency and controllability. In this paper, a liquid drug release module device that can be assembled on a micro-robot drive module is proposed, which uses a rotating magnetic field to push the internal spiral rotation structure, and pushes the piston at the bottom of the drug warehouse to squeeze the internal space of the drug warehouse, to achieve the purpose of releasing liquid drugs at a fixed point in the digestive tract.",0
"Neuromuscular Controller Embedded in a Powered Ankle Exoskeleton: Effects on Gait, Clinical Features and Subjective Perspective of Incomplete Spinal Cord Injured Subjects","Powered exoskeletons are among the emerging technologies claiming to assist functional ambulation. The potential to adapt robotic assistance based on specific motor abilities of incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) subjects, is crucial to optimize Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Achilles, an autonomous wearable robot able to assist ankle during walking, was developed for iSCI subjects and utilizes a NeuroMuscular Controller (NMC). NMC can be used to adapt robotic assistance based on specific residual functional abilities of subjects. The main aim of this pilot study was to analyze the effects of the NMC-controlled Achilles, used as an assistive device, on chronic iSCI participants' performance, by assessing gait speed during 10-session training of robot-aided walking. Secondary aims were to assess training impact on participants' motion, clinical and functional features and to evaluate subjective perspective in terms of attitude towards technology, workload, usability and satisfaction. Results showed that 5 training sessions were necessary to significantly improve robot-aided gait speed on short paths and consequently to optimize HRI. Moreover, the training allowed participants who initially were not able to walk for 6 minutes, to improve gait endurance during Achilles-aided walking and to reduce perceived fatigue. Improvements were obtained also in gait speed during free walking, thus suggesting a potential rehabilitative impact, even if Achilles-aided walking was not faster than free walking. Participants' subjective evaluations indicated a positive experience.",0
Driver monitoring systems (DMS): The future of impaired driving management?,"ObjectiveDriver monitoring systems (DMS) are the next generation of vehicle safety technology. Broadly, these refer to the embedded, aftermarket wearable or vehicle-mounted devices that collect observable information about the operator to make real-time assessment of their capacity to perform the driving task. Integrating biobehavioral monitoring (primarily ocular metrics) with driving performance assessments, these systems function to infer driver state in real time to identify operator conditions that negatively affect driving (such as fatigue, inattention, or distraction).MethodWe review available methods used to infer driver state, as referenced against accepted models for optimal performance. Modeling our observations on deviation from predetermined performance thresholds used to trigger graded safety alerts, we suggest that many psychoactive substances produce alterations to biobehavioral processes including attentional and motor control, which affect performance indices in a manner already arguably captured by these technologies.ResultsUsing these existing frameworks, there is considerable potential to similarly catalogue the effect of many common intoxicants known to negatively affect driving ability. This will provide safety-relevant and practical biological models for the development of next-generation multimodal DMS that integrate ocular and physiological variables sensitive to the effects of common and emergent psychoactive substances.ConclusionThese devices have tangible potential application across all areas of transportation, including aviation, rail, and all commercial and private vehicle systems.",1
Fatigue-driving Recognition Based on the State of the Human Eye and Electroencephalographic Signal,"The paper apply dual indicators based on eye's state and electroencephalographic signals to identify whether the driver is at the state of fatigue or not. This method improves the detection rate and detection precision, reduce error detection rate, and increase system's robustness and stability compared with single eye movement signal or electroencephalographic signals. The first step is to collect eye's state information, then use the PERCLOS algorithm to identify whether a driver is at the state of fatigue or not. At the same time the power ratio of alpha, beta and theta which are received by parallel processing EEG signal identifies whether the driver is at the state of fatigue or not. As long as the system meets one of the two indicators, the driver is identified to fatigue and the system make alarm.",1
Impact of Tai Chi Therapy on Fatigue and Cognitive Function in Individuals With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a psychosomatic disorder characterized by persistent fatigue, primarily involving physical and mental exhaustion, with greater emphasis on the latter. This leads to a deterioration in concentration and memory. These symptoms affect cognitive functions, including attention and memory, to varying degrees. Previous research has shown that Tai Chi can help reduce fatigue in individuals with CFS. However, the relationship between alleviating CFS-related fatigue through Tai Chi and its impact on cognitive functions remains unclear. The effects of Tai Chi on cognitive functions in individuals with CFS have not been clinically validated, and its efficacy and safety have yet to be examined through large-scale randomized controlled trials. Therefore, this protocol outlines a pilot randomized, parallel, single-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the impact of Tai Chi therapy on fatigue and cognitive functions in individuals with CFS, using both subjective and objective assessments.OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aims to explore the preliminary efficacy and safety of Tai Chi in reducing fatigue and improving cognitive function in patients with CFS, and to generate data to inform future large-scale trials.METHODS: We will conduct a randomized, analyst-blinded, parallel-controlled trial with a 12-week intervention period and a 4-week follow-up. Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to either the Tai Chi group (30 patients) or the health education group (30 patients). The Tai Chi group will receive the 24-style simplified Tai Chi intervention, while the control group will receive a health education intervention. Following the 12-week intervention, a 4-week follow-up will be conducted. The Tai Chi group will train 3 times per week, consisting of 2 in-person sessions at the Physical Education Center of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and 1 self-directed session guided online by an instructor. The primary outcome measure is the 20-item Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). The secondary outcome measures include the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Attention Network Test (ANT), working memory performance (N-Back task), and magnetic resonance imaging.RESULTS: The research protocol and informed consent form were approved by the Shanghai Clinical Research Ethics Committee on March 18, 2024 (approval number SECCR2024-22-01). Participant recruitment began in April 2024. All interventions and concurrent data collection will be completed by October 2025, and the 4-week postintervention follow-up assessments will be finalized by the end of October 2025. Data management is still ongoing; therefore, data analysis has not yet been performed.CONCLUSIONS: As a pilot trial, the findings of this study will provide preliminary clinical evidence on the role of Tai Chi in improving cognitive function in patients with CFS and will serve as a foundation for designing future large-scale trials.TRIAL REGISTRATION: China Clinical Trials Registry ChiCTR2400082268; https://tinyurl.com/2tkr7j7x.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/65958.",0
Electroencephalographic assessment of infant spinal anesthesia: A pilot prospective observational study,"Introduction Spinal anesthesia is utilized as an alternative to general anesthesia in infants for some surgeries. After spinal anesthesia, infants often become less conscious without administration of sedative medications. The aim of this study was to assess electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates after spinal anesthesia in a cohort of infants. Patients and Methods This pilot study included 12 infants who underwent spinal anesthesia. Unprocessed electroencephalography was recorded. The electroencephalogram was interpreted by four neurologists. Processed analyses compared electroencephalogram changes 30 min after spinal anesthesia to baseline. Results Following spinal anesthesia, all 12 infants became sedated. Electroencephalography in all 12 demonstrated Stage 2 sleep with the appearance of sleep spindles (12-14 Hz) in the frontal and central leads in 8/12 (67%) of subjects. The median time to onset of sleep spindles was 24.7 interquartile range (21.2, 29.9) min. The duration of sleep spindles was 25.1 interquartile range (5.8, 99.8) min. Voltage attenuation and background slowing were the most common initial changes. Compared to baseline, the electroencephalogram 30 min after spinal anesthesia showed significantly increased absolute delta power (p = 0.02) and gamma power (p < 0.0001); decreases in beta (p = 0.0006) and higher beta (p < 0.0001) were also observed. The Fast Fourier Transform power ratio difference for delta/beta was increased (p = 0.03). Increased coherence was noted in the delta (p = 0.02) and theta (p = 0.04) bandwidths. Discussion Spinal anesthesia in infants is associated with increased electroencephalographic slow wave activity and decreased beta activity compared to the awake state, with appearance of sleep spindles suggestive of normal sleep. The etiology and significance of the observed voltage attenuation and background slowing remains unclear. Conclusions The EEG signature of infant spinal anesthesia is distinct from that seen with general anesthesia and is consistent with normal sleep. Further investigation is required to better understand the etiology of these findings. Our preliminary findings contribute to the understanding of the brain effects of spinal anesthesia in early development.",0
A Two-Stage Intelligent Model to Extract Features from PPG for Drowsiness Detection,"This paper presented a two-stage intelligent model that combined the wavelet packet transform (WPT) and functional-link-based fuzzy neural network (FLFNN) to access drowsy level. Early detection of drowsiness can help prevent drivers from involving in car accidents. According to the report of U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drivers falling asleep while driving were responsible for at least 100,000 automobile crashes annually that resulted in an annual average of 40,000 non-fatal injuries and 1,550 fatalities [3]. Furthermore, the National Sleep Foundation had reported that 60% of adult drivers drove with drowsy and 37% of them had eventually fallen asleep during driving [4]. The fact behind those reports indicated that there is a dire need to develop a sensor device that detects drowsy status at an early stage.",1
Fast eyes detection in thermal images,"In recent years many methods have been proposed for eye detection. In some cases however, such as driver drowsiness detection, lighting conditions are so challenging that only the thermal imaging is a robust alternative to the visible light sensors. However, thermal images suffer from poor contrast and high noise, which arise due to the physical properties of the long waves processing. In this paper we propose an efficient method for eyes detection based on thermal image processing which can be successfully used in challenging environments. Image pre-processing with novel virtual high dynamic range procedure is proposed, which greatly enhances thermal image contrast and allows for more reliable computation of sparse image descriptors. The bag-of-visual-words approach with clustering was selected for final detections. We compare our method with the YOLOv3 deep learning model. Our method attains high accuracy and fast response in real conditions without computational complexity and requirement of a big dataset associated with the deep neural networks. For quantitative analysis a series of thermal video sequences were recorded in which eye locations were manually annotated. Created dataset was made publicly available on our website.",1
Caring about Preemies' Safe Sleep (CaPSS) An Educational Program to Improve Adherence to Safe Sleep Recommendations by Mothers of Preterm Infants,"Preterm infants born before 37 weeks' gestation die of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at a rate more than double that of term infants. There is a need for SIDS prevention programs tailored to the specific needs of parents of high-risk infants. The purpose of this study was to pilot test an online educational module addressing SIDS risk-reduction recommendations (RRRs) for parents of preterm infants. This study was conducted in a 44-bed transitional care unit at a level IV NICU in the Midwest. A repeated-measures design was used. Two weeks before discharge, mothers completed a survey, addressing knowledge and plans for caring for their baby at home. Mothers then viewed the 5-section Caring about Preemies' Safe Sleep (CaPSS) education module and completed the postmodule evaluation. A discharge survey was completed 4 weeks postdischarge. Fifteen mothers, mean age 26.4 years, participated; 8 (53%) returned the postdischarge survey. Module evaluation rated clarity and completeness of information high. Mothers' ratings of SIDS knowledge were significantly higher after viewing the module (P = .000) and 4 weeks after discharge home (P = .012). Mothers found the use of a pacifier at sleep times to be new information and changed their plans for caring for their infant, with 28.6% of mothers always offering a pacifier before sleep after discharge compared with the 6.7% who had planned to do this before discharge. However, only 71% of infants slept in parents' room after discharge and only 41% were receiving at least some breast milk, which are not consistent with SIDS RRRs.",0
Eye Recognition in Near-Infrared Images for Driver's Drowsiness Monitoring,The paper presents a system for driver's eye recognition from near infrared (NIR) images. The system is organized in a cascade of two classification modules. The first one is responsible for initial eye detection and the second one for eye validation. Detection is based on a novel eye model suited for the NIR images. This process is augmented by the background subtraction module. The subsequent stage of eye validation is performed by the second classifier based on the higher-order decomposition of a tensor with geometrically deformed prototypes. Obtained results in day and night conditions show high accuracy and real-time processing of the system in software implementation.,1
Assessment of Reliability and Remaining Fatigue Life of Topside Piping Using Dynamic Bayesian Network,"Hydrocarbon release due to Vibration Induced Fatigue (VIF) costs millions of dollars each year in inspection, maintenance and replacement activities, as well as lost production for oil and gas operators. Therefore, it is vital to assess the reliability of topside piping against VIE In this context, the authors have utilized the fundamentals of probability, reliability and statistical methods, using Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) to estimate the reliability of process piping. Firstly, different sources of uncertainty, such as physical variability, statistical uncertainty, etc., in the crack growth process (Paris law is used to model the crack growth) are identified and quantified, with suitable distributions and parameters obtained from literature. Thereafter, a DBN is developed to obtain the distribution of the Remaining Fatigue Life (RFL). The results (in terms of crack size) are validated against experimental data. Thereafter, statistical methods are used to obtain the reliability/PoF curve from the RFL distribution derived previously, which can be used to set up an inspection schedule, as illustrated in the case study. The advantage of using DBNs for reliability analyses lies in the ease of updating the prior information to obtain the posterior distributions.",0
Diabetes Mellitus Prevalence and Control in Sleep-Disordered Breathing The European Sleep Apnea Cohort (ESADA) Study,"BACKGROUND: OSA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity. A driver of this is metabolic dysfunction and in particular type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Prior studies identifying a link between OSA and T2DM have excluded subjects with undiagnosed T2DM, and there is a lack of population-level data on the interaction between OSA and glycemic control among patients with diabetes. We assessed the relationship between OSA severity and T2DM prevalence and control in a large multinational population.METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 6,616 participants in the European Sleep Apnea Cohort (ESADA) study, using multivariate regression analysis to assess T2DM prevalence according to OSA severity, as measured by the oxyhemoglobin desaturation index. Patients with diabetes were identified by previous history and medication prescription, and by screening for undiagnosed diabetes with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement. The relationship of OSA severity with glycemic control was assessed in diabetic subjects.RESULTS: T2DM prevalence increased with OSA severity, from 6.6% in subjects without OSA to 28.9% in those with severe OSA. Despite adjustment for obesity and other confounding factors, in comparison with subjects free of OSA, patients with mild, moderate, or severe disease had an OR (95% CI) of 1.33 (1.04-1.72), 1.73 (1.33-2.25), and 1.87 (1.45-2.42) (P < .001), respectively, for prevalent T2DM. Diabetic subjects with more severe OSA had worse glycemic control, with adjusted mean HbA1c levels 0.72% higher in patients with severe OSA than in those without sleep-disordered breathing (analysis of covariance, P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Increasing OSA severity is associated with increased likelihood of concomitant T2DM and worse diabetic control in patients with T2DM.",0
The Analysis of Controlled Flight Into Terrain Incidents From Flight Crew Perspective Using Named Entity Recognition and Bayesian Networks,"Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) can result in significant aircraft damage and human casualties. Analyzing incident factors and their evolutionary relationships in aviation safety reports helps explore the inherent mechanisms of CFIT, thereby potentially reducing their occurrence. This study proposes a methodology combining named entity recognition (NER) and Bayesian network (BN) to address the challenges of efficiently extracting incident factors from textual reports from the crew's perspective and analyzing the overall evolution process of CFIT incidents to better prevent accidents. First, this study collected 354 CFIT incident reports in the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) for the period November 2021 to August 2023. Second, important concepts from Threat and Error Management (TEM) were referenced to determine principles for extracting factor types and their evolutionary relationships. Third, NER was applied using the BERT-BiLSTM-MHA-CRF model to extract incident factors, followed by model comparison. Experimental results demonstrated good performance with precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.97, 0.90, and 0.90, respectively. Last, BN was then employed to analyze the CFIT evolution process. Results indicate that if factors such as Terrain (0.04) and Unfamiliarity/Inexperience (0.036) are present, CFIT risk will increase. Conversely, if protective factors such as Perfect Weather/Great Visibility (0.397) and Perform the Escape Maneuver (0.341) are present, CFIT risk will decrease. The analysis reveals that Airline Operational Pressure, Fatigue (57%), Lack of Situational Awareness (21%), Automation Errors (45%), Aircraft Handling Deviations (34%), Aviation System-Based Countermeasures (72%), Perform the Escape Maneuver (75%), and Make a Stabilized Approach (89%) form the highest probability evolution pathway for CFIT incidents. This study concludes that reducing these identified risk factors and increasing protective factors can contribute to reducing CFIT accidents.",0
"The metabolic response during resistance training and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in patients with COPD, a pilot study","Resistance training and transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) are new modalities in rehabilitation of severely disabled patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose of this study was to compare the metabolic response during resistance training and during NMES of the quadriceps femoris muscles in patients with COPD entering pulmonary rehabilitation.Pulmonary function, body composition, peak aerobic capacity, the Medical Research Council dyspnoea grade, the one-repetition maximum strength assessment were evaluated in 13 COPD patients. Additionally, peak oxygen uptake, peak minute ventilation and Borg symptom scores were assessed during a resistance training session and a NMES session. The median peak oxygen uptake and median peak minute ventilation during the resistance training session were significantly higher compared to the NMES session. Additionally, these higher metabolic responses were accompanied by higher symptom Borg scores for dyspnoea and leg fatigue.To conclude, the metabolic response was significantly tower during a NMES session compared to a resistance exercise training session in patients with COPD. Nevertheless, both modalities seem to result in an acceptable metabolic response accompanied by a clinically acceptable sensation of dyspnoea and leg fatigue. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Is cellular energy monitoring more responsive to hypoxia than pulse oximetry?,"Purpose Pulse oximetry is the current standard for detecting drops in arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) associated with obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea events in polysomnographic (PSG) testing. However, cellular energy monitoring (CE monitoring), a measure related to cellular hypoxia in the skin, is likely to be more responsive to inadequate breathing during sleep because during hypoxic challenge, such as occurs during apneic events, regulatory mechanisms restrict blood flow to the skin to preferentially maintain SpO(2)for more vital organs. We carried out initial proof of concept testing to determine if CE monitoring has promise for being more responsive to hypoxic challenge occurring during sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) than pulse oximetry. Methods We assessed both CE monitoring and pulse oximetry in a series of conditions which affect oxygen supply: (1) breathing nitrogen or 100% oxygen, (2) physical exertion, and (3) studying a night of sleep in an individual known to be a loud snorer. We also present the results of a preliminary study comparing CE monitoring to pulse oximetry in eight individuals undergoing standard clinical overnight polysomnography for suspected SDB. Results CE monitoring is responsive to changes in cellular oxygen supply to the skin and detects hypoxia during SDB events that is not detected by pulse oximetry. Conclusion CE monitoring is a promising tool for identifying pathology at the mild end of the SDB spectrum.",0
Development of the Performance Measure for Activities of Daily Living-8 for Patients with Congestive Heart Failure: A Preliminary Study,"Background: Functional limitations often lead to hospitalization, disease progression, and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Functional limitations become a particular problem among older patients. Self-reported questionnaires have been found to be a reliable and accurate methodology for obtaining information on functional limitations. However, current measures have been criticized for their inability to guide therapy on the basis of outcome data and for the lack of specificity of questions related to disease-specific symptoms. Objective: To develop the Performance Measure for Activities of Daily Living-8 (PMADL-8) to assess functional limitations in CHF patients and to provide preliminary data on internal consistency of the PMADL-8, as well as its reliability and validity. Methods: Using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model, functional limitation questionnaire items to assess difficulty in 8 common daily tasks in CHF patients were developed. The instrument was constructed based on input from a panel of experts and by pilot testing. Its construct and convergent validity, Rasch analysis, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability were evaluated in 50 CHF patients. Discriminative/ known-group validity was investigated by comparing 37 elderly CHF patients and 37 age-and sex-matched controls from the general population. Results: Cronbach's alpha of the PMADL-8 was 0.94. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.96. The PMADL-8 was unidimensional and fitted the Rasch model. Expected differences in the PMADL-8 scores of known-groups show its discriminative/known-group validity. The PMADL-8 had good correlations with the dyspnea (r = 0.77, p < 0.01) and fatigue scores of the Marianna Heart Failure Questionnaire (r = 0.69, p < 0.01) and the New York Heart Association classification (F = 26.7, p < 0.01), demonstrating its convergent validity. Between 2 groups divided by the median scores of PMADL-8, there were significant differences in some disease-specific measures: grip strength, knee extensor muscle strength, and brain natriuretic peptide levels. Conclusion: The PMADL-8 had good internal consistency and test-retest reliability, as well as discriminative and convergent validity in CHF patients. Therefore, the PMADL-8 has the potential to be used to assess disease-specific functional limitations in CHF patients. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel",0
RGB-D Imaging Used for OSAS Diagnostics (A Pilot Study),"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a respiratory disorder increasing its prevalence with significant consequences for pediatric patients. The accurate diagnostics of this syndrome is now very time consuming procedure consisting mainly of video polysomnography in sleep laboratory. Due to absence of sleep laboratories (pediatric sleep laboratory is only at Clinic of Children and Adolescents in Martin), the authors of this pilot study focus on using RGB-D depth imaging for supporting diagnostics of OSAS. Based on questionnaire of pediatric specialists from Rome (Italy) specific dentofacial (craniofacial) features measured on head strongly correlate with OSAS occurrence and patients for more accurate diagnostics can be selected during the primary examination. Authors bring a comparison of some RGB-D sensors and measurements for selected dentofacial features to create supporting, non-invasive, automated and fast method for preliminary confirmation of OSAS.",0
Driving training and behaviour among young adults with cerebral palsy-A follow-up pilot study,"Objective: Investigate medical, demographic and neuropsychological variables associated with driving in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). Methods: This study has a retrospective cohort design. A follow-up survey was sent to former patients with CP that previously had passed a multidisciplinary driving assessment. Participants included a total of 17 persons, 3 men and 14 women, mean age 26 years at follow-up. The followup survey included data from driving training, self-reported driving behaviour and measures of perceived pain and fatigue. The survey data was analysed in comparison with retrospective medical and neuropsychological data. Results: Two-thirds of the participants had obtained a valid driver's license at the time of followup. Cognitive impairments were found within both the driving and non-driving group, but more severely among the non-drivers. A subgroup had been repeatedly involved in traffic incidents and crashes. Conclusion: When assessing fitness to drive in persons with CP, clinicians need to give realistic prognostics based on a multidisciplinary clinical assessment before starting the arduous and costly process that obtaining a driving license represents.",0
"Delta-9-THC based monotherapy in fibromyalgia patients on experimentally induced pain, axon reflex flare, and pain relief","Objective: Fibromyalgia ( FM) is a chronic pain syndrome characterized by a distinct mechanical hyperalgesia and chronic pain. Recently, cannabinoids have been demonstrated as providing anti-nociceptive and anti-hyperalgesic effects in animal and human studies. Here, we explored in nine FM patients the efficacy of orally administered delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on electrically induced pain, axon reflex flare, and psychometric variables.Research design and methods: Patients received a daily dose of 2.5-15 mg of delta-9-THC, with a weekly increase of 2.5 mg, as long as no side effects were reported. Psychometric variables were assessed each week by means of the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Medical outcome survey-short form (MOS SF-36), the Pain Disability Index (PDI), and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). In addition, patients recorded daily, in a diary, their overall pain intensity on a numeric scale. Each week, pain and axon reflex flare was evoked experimentally by administration of high intensity constant current pulses (1 Hz, pulse width 0.2 ms, current increase stepwise from 2.5-12.5 mA every 3 minutes) delivered via small surface electrodes, attached to the volar forearm skin.Main outcome measures: Daily pain recordings by the patient, experimentally induced pain, and axon reflex flare recorded by a laser Doppler scanner.Results: Five of nine FM patients withdrew during the study due to adverse side effects. Delta-9-THC had no effect on the axon reflex flare, whereas electrically induced pain was significantly attenuated after doses of 10-15 mg delta-9-THC (p < 0.05). Daily-recorded pain of the FM patients was significantly reduced (p < 0.01).Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated that a generalized statement that delta-9-THC is an analgetic drug cannot be made. However, a sub-population of FM patients reported significant benefit from the delta-9-THC monotherapy. The unaffected electrically induced axon reflex flare, but decreased pain perception, suggests a central mode of action of the cannabinoid.",0
Heart rate variability as an indicator of fatigue: A structural equation model approach,"Driver fatigue significantly impairs performance and is a major risk factor for road crashes. However, fatigue is difficult to objectively measure and quantify. This study aimed to elucidate associations between heart rate variability (HRV) metrics and multidimensional fatigue construct encompassing objective and subjective measures in young drivers with self-reported short sleep. Eighty-four young adults underwent assessments during simulated driving. HRV indices RMSSD and LF/HF ratio were derived from an electrocardiogram, while relative Theta power, oculography drowsiness, lane position variability, and Karolinska Sleepiness Score measured fatigue. RMSSD negatively correlated with Theta power, and LF/HF ratio positively correlated with position variability. Exploratory factor analysis extracted three factors, with RMSSD and LF/HF loading onto one. Structural equation modelling tested the prediction of a latent fatigue construct from HRV. Two models demonstrated an acceptable fit. RMSSD negatively predicted fatigue, explaining 6.4 % of the variance, while the LF/HF ratio positively predicted fatigue, accounting for 3.7 % of the variance. In summary, HRV, particularly RMSSD, showed significant relationships with multidimensional fatigue. Lower RMSSD and higher LF/HF ratio are associated with greater fatigue levels. This study demonstrates that HRV indices exhibit significant relationships within a multidimensional model of fatigue incorporating objective performance, ocular, and subjective measures. The findings provide initial evidence towards using HRV for monitoring complex manifestations of fatigue, rather than single dimensions. Further applied research should investigate translating these findings to naturalistic settings and validating HRV thresholds predictive of on-road impairment.",1
Functional connectivity correlates of attentional networks in insomnia disorder: A pilot study,"Insomnia disorder has been associated with poor executive functioning. Functional imaging studies of executive functioning in insomnia are scarce and inconclusive. Because the Attentional Network Test relies on well-defined cortical networks and sensitively distinguishes different aspects of executive function, it might reveal brain functional alterations in relatively small samples of patients. The current pilot study assessed functional connectivity during the Attentional Network Test performed using magnetic resonance imaging in 12 participants with insomnia and 13 self-defined good sleepers. ANCOVAs were used to evaluate group differences in performance and functional connectivity in the regions of interest representing the attentional networks (i.e. alerting, orienting and executive control) at p < 0.05, uncorrected. During the orienting part, participants with insomnia showed weaker connectivity of the precentral gyrus with the superior parietal lobe (false discovery rate-corrected), while they showed stronger connectivity between premotor and visual regions. Individual differences in connectivity between premotor and visual regions correlated inversely with reaction time. Reaction times suggested more efficient executive control in participants with insomnia compared with good sleepers. During the executive control part, participants with insomnia showed stronger connectivity of thalamic parts of the arousal circuit with the middle frontal and the occipital gyri. Conversely, connectivity between the inferior and superior frontal gyri was weaker. Participants with insomnia seem to recruit more cortical resources in visuo-motor regions to orient attention than good sleepers do, and seem to have enhanced executive control that relates to stronger connectivity of arousal-related thalamic areas. This latter result should be treated with caution and requires confirmation.",0
Driver Drowsiness Detection Based on Multisource Information,"Driver drowsiness is one of the major causes of on-road accidents. Abnormal eye behavior, steering wheel activity, and vehicle trajectory during different drowsiness stages were studied in detail to overcome the limitations of single-sensor approaches. Some measures, such as percentage of eyelid closure, maximum close duration, and percentage of nonsteering were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. Moreover, a two-stage data fusion framework was developed for the modeling combination of information from different sources. Fisher's linear discriminant was implied as the feature-level fusion method, and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory was introduced in the decision-level fusion process. The results suggest that the recognition system proposed here provided 90.7% accuracy. The reliability and accuracy of the fusion method were significantly higher than those of single sensors.

Lung Function in African Infants: A Pilot Study,"BackgroundThe burden of childhood respiratory illness is large in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Infant lung function (ILF) testing may provide useful information about lung growth and susceptibility to respiratory disease. However, ILF has not been widely available in LMICs settings where the greatest burden of childhood respiratory disease occurs.AimTo implement and evaluate a pilot study of ILF testing in a semi-rural setting in South Africa.MethodInfant lung function testing was established at a community hospital in South Africa. All measures were done in unsedated infants during sleep. Measurements, made with the infant quietly breathing through a face mask and bacterial filter, included tidal breathing (TBFVL), exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), and sulphur hexafluoride multiple breath washout (MBW) measures using an ultrasonic flow meter and chemoluminescent NO analyzer.ResultsTwenty infants, mean age of 7.7 (SD 2.9) weeks were tested; 8 (40%) were Black African and 12 (60%) were mixed race. Five (25%) infants were preterm. There were 19 (95%) successful TBFVL and NO tests and 18 (90%) successful MBW tests. The mean tidal volume was 30.5ml (SD 5.9), respiratory rate 50.2 breaths per minute (SD 8.7), and eNO 10.4 ppb (SD 7.3). The mean MBW measures were: functional residual capacity 71ml (SD 13) and the lung clearance index 7.6 (SD 0.5). The intra-subject coefficient of variations (CV) of lung function measures were similar to published normative data for Caucasian European infants.ConclusionIn this study we demonstrate that unsedated infant lung function measures of tidal breathing, MBW, and eNO are feasible in a semi-rural African setting with rates comparable to those reported from high income countries.

Design of a Fatigue Detection System for High-Speed Trains Based on Driver Vigilance Using a Wireless Wearable EEG,"The vigilance of the driver is important for railway safety, despite not being included in the safety management system (SMS) for high-speed train safety. In this paper, a novel fatigue detection system for high-speed train safety based on monitoring train driver vigilance using a wireless wearable electroencephalograph (EEG) is presented. This system is designed to detect whether the driver is drowsiness. The proposed system consists of three main parts: (1) a wireless wearable EEG collection; (2) train driver vigilance detection; and (3) early warning device for train driver. In the first part, an 8-channel wireless wearable brain-computer interface (BCI) device acquires the locomotive driver's brain EEG signal comfortably under high-speed train-driving conditions. The recorded data are transmitted to a personal computer (PC) via Bluetooth. In the second step, a support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm is implemented to determine the vigilance level using the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) to extract the EEG power spectrum density (PSD). In addition, an early warning device begins to work if fatigue is detected. The simulation and test results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed fatigue detection system for high-speed train safety.",1
The Tayside children's sleep questionnaire: a simple tool to evaluate sleep problems in young children,"Background Behavioural sleep problems in young children are relatively common with between 20% and 40% of those aged 1 to 5 years being affected. This paper describes the development of a simple questionnaire to assess disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS) in children aged between 1 and 5 years for use as a selection tool for research purposes or as a screening instrument in primary care.Methods A subsection of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children was adapted and piloted with a small sample of children in two inner city GP practices (n = 81). Face and content validity were initially established by expert review. Discriminant validity was assessed qualitatively using interviews with mothers of identified cases and non-cases. The validity of the cut-off score was assessed by blinded case note reviews off known cases; inter-rater reliability was also calculated. Following modifications, the final questionnaire was posted to a representative sample of parents across the region with children in the appropriate age band (n = 1023). Internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and factor analysis was undertaken to identify significant factors within the questionnaire.Results The response rate to the population questionnaire was 61.5% (n=628) with 218 of the children having sleep scores that were indicative of DIMS (35%), echoing other figures reported in the literature. There was good internal consistency for the items (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85) with two main factors accounting for 58% of the variance.Conclusion The Tayside Children's Sleep Questionnaire (TCSQ) is an easy-to-read and reliable tool that could be used both as a clinical and research instrument to assess the severity and prevalence of DIMS in young children.",0
Fatigue Crack Detection in Aircraft Riveted Panels using Frequency/Phase Analysis of Lamb Waves,"Aircraft designers, manufacturers and operators face many challenges related to maintenance in the near future. Existing ageing aircraft structures already require a significant maintenance effort. The application of new materials and wider use of damage-tolerant concepts in new aircraft will also require reliable damage monitoring for quality control, with regular periodic inspections to maintain the safe life.Over recent years, a number of new technologies have evolved with the potential for health monitoring of aerospace structures. Lamb wave inspection is the most widely used damage detection technique based on guided ultrasonic waves, i.e. ultrasonic waves propagating in bounded media. The majority of current signal processing techniques used for the analysis of Lamb wave responses rely on amplitudes and/or mode conversion. The paper explores the correlation characteristics of Lamb waves at progressing damage stages. Signal parameters used for damage detection are applied to Lamb wave data obtained from an aerospace riveted panel to detect fatigue cracks. The results demonstrate good sensitivity of the method to small fatigue cracks.",0
Wearable Mobile-Based Emotional Response-Monitoring System for Drivers,"Negative emotional responses are a growing problem among drivers, particularly in countries with heavy traffic, and may lead to serious accidents on the road. Measuring stress-and fatigue-induced emotional responses by means of a wireless, wearable system would be useful for potentially averting roadway tragedies. The focus of this study was to develop and verify an emotional response-monitoring paradigm for drivers, derived from electromyography signals of the upper trapezius muscle, photoplethysmography signals of the earlobe, as well as inertialmotion sensing of the head movement. The relevant sensors were connected to a microcontroller unit equipped with a Bluetooth-enabled low-energy module, which allows the transmission of those sensor readings to a mobile device in real time. A mobile device application was then used to extract the data from the sensors and to determine the driver's current emotion status, via a trained support vector machine (SVM). The emotional response paradigm, tested in ten subjects, consisted of 10 min baseline, 5 min prestimulus, and 5 min poststimulus measurements. Emotional responses were categorized into three classes: relaxed, stressed, and fatigued. The analysis integrated a total of 36 features to train the SVM model, and the final stimulus results revealed a high accuracy rate (99.52%). The proposed wearable system could be applied to an intelligent driver's safety alert system, to use those emotional responses to prevent accidents affecting themselves and/or other innocent victims.",1
Adaptive Frame-Aware Network for Driver Monitoring Systems,"Driver monitoring systems (DMS) are crucial for enhancing road safety by detecting driver behaviors and states such as drowsiness, distraction, and other potentially hazardous actions. In this research, we propose a novel approach using Adaptive Frame Aware Network (AFAN) for sequence classification in driver monitoring. Our model leverages frame embedding, adaptive attention, and sequence classification to accurately classify driver behaviors. We evaluate our model on two distinct datasets, including sequences collected on a private test setup, demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse conditions. The results show significant improvements over existing methods, achieving up to more than twice faster inference time and up to 88% memory size reduction, highlighting the potential of AFAN for real-time driver monitoring applications.",1
"Personalised Health Behaviour Support Programme in Adults With Post-COVID Syndrome: A Randomised, Controlled Pilot Feasibility Trial","BackgroundWe investigated whether a novel 8-week personalised health behaviour support programme, focusing on the stability of symptoms and strategies to improve activities of daily living, was feasible and acceptable in adults with post-COVID syndrome.MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, pilot feasibility trial, 32 adults with post-COVID syndrome (continued symptoms for >= 12 weeks) were randomised 1:1 to receive personalised health behaviour support (self-reported physical activity and symptom diaries, plus seven one-to-one remotely delivered personalised self-management support sessions), once weekly for 8-weeks, or usual care (referral to online 'your COVID-19 recovery' programme). The primary outcome was the feasibility of recruiting and randomising adults with post-COVID syndrome. The secondary outcomes were to assess the acceptability and safety of the intervention and various outcome measures.ResultsOf the 48 adults who expressed interest in the study, 32 (67%) were eligible and completed the baseline assessment. All 32 adults were willing to be randomised to either the personalised health behaviour support programme (n = 17) or usual care (n = 15) and 27 (age: 45 +/- 12 years) adults completed follow-up at 9 weeks. The intervention was deemed feasible, with high adherence (92% and 94% completion rates for the physical activity and symptom diaries, respectively) and excellent acceptability rates (94% 'liked the intervention a lot'). The intervention was deemed safe, with no symptom exacerbations reported.ConclusionAn 8-week personalised health behaviour support programme was feasible for adults with post-COVID syndrome, with good adherence and acceptability rates. Early pilot data from this small sample also suggests meaningful improvements in physical activity, fatigue and respiratory symptoms.Patient or Public ContributionPeople living with post-COVID syndrome were involved from the outset with the study design, review of study documentation and interpretation of the data following completion. Furthermore, several participants have supported the local dissemination of findings following the completion of the study.",0
A dynamic simulator for the ergonomics evaluation of powered torque tools for human assembly,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to design and develop a testing device to simulate interaction between human hand-arm dynamics, right-angle (RA) computer-controlled power torque tools and joint-tightening task-related variables.Design/methodology/approach - The testing rig can simulate a variety of tools, tasks and operator conditions. The device includes custom data-acquisition electronics and graphical user interface-based software. The simulation of the human hand-arm dynamics is based on the rig's four-bar mechanism-based design and mechanical components that provide adjustable stiffness (via pneumatic cylinder) and mass (via plates) and non-adjustable damping. The stiffness and mass values used are based on an experimentally validated hand-arm model that includes a database of model parameters. This database is with respect to gender and working posture, corresponding to experienced tool operators from a prior study.Findings - The rig measures tool handle force and displacement responses simultaneously. Peak force and displacement coefficients of determination (R2) between rig estimations and human testing measurements were 0.98 and 0.85, respectively, for the same set of tools, tasks and operator conditions. The rig also provides predicted tool operator acceptability ratings, using a data set from a prior study of discomfort in experienced operators during torque tool use.Research limitations/implications - Deviations from linearity may influence handle force and displacement measurements. Stiction (Coulomb friction) in the overall rig, as well as in the air cylinder piston, is neglected. The rig's mechanical damping is not adjustable, despite the fact that human hand-arm damping varies with respect to gender and working posture. Deviations from these assumptions may affect the correlation of the handle force and displacement measurements with those of human testing for the same tool, task and operator conditions.Practical implications - This test rig will allow the rapid assessment of the ergonomic performance of DC torque tools, saving considerable time in lineside applications and reducing the risk of worker injury. DC torque tools are an extremely effective way of increasing production rate and improving torque accuracy. Being a complex dynamic system, however, the performance of DC torque tools varies in each application. Changes in worker mass, damping and stiffness, as well as joint stiffness and tool program, make each application unique. This test rig models all of these factors and allows quick assessment.Social implications - The use of this tool test rig will help to identify and understand risk factors that contribute to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) associated with the use of torque tools. Tool operators are subjected to large impulsive handle reaction forces, as joint torque builds up while tightening a fastener. Repeated exposure to such forces is associated with muscle soreness, fatigue and physical stress which are also risk factors for upper extremity injuries (MSDs; e.g. tendinosis, myofascial pain). Eccentric exercise exertions are known to cause damage to muscle tissue in untrained individuals and affect subsequent performance.Originality/value - The rig provides a novel means for quantitative, repeatable dynamic evaluation of RA powered torque tools and objective selection of tightening programs. Compared to current static tool assessment methods, dynamic testing provides a more realistic tool assessment relative to the tool operator's experience. This may lead to improvements in tool or controller design and reduction in associated musculoskeletal discomfort in operators.",0
A Review of Recent Developments in Driver Drowsiness Detection Systems,"Continuous advancements in computing technology and artificial intelligence in the past decade have led to improvements in driver monitoring systems. Numerous experimental studies have collected real driver drowsiness data and applied various artificial intelligence algorithms and feature combinations with the goal of significantly enhancing the performance of these systems in real-time. This paper presents an up-to-date review of the driver drowsiness detection systems implemented over the last decade. The paper illustrates and reviews recent systems using different measures to track and detect drowsiness. Each system falls under one of four possible categories, based on the information used. Each system presented in this paper is associated with a detailed description of the features, classification algorithms, and used datasets. In addition, an evaluation of these systems is presented, in terms of the final classification accuracy, sensitivity, and precision. Furthermore, the paper highlights the recent challenges in the area of driver drowsiness detection, discusses the practicality and reliability of each of the four system types, and presents some of the future trends in the field.",1
A pilot study on the feasibility and effectiveness of treadmill-based perturbations for assessing and improving walking stability in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Background: Falls risk is elevated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the contributing factors. Here, we examined the feasibility of, and initial responses to, large walking perturbations in COPD, as well as the adaptation potential of people with COPD to repeated walking perturbations that might indicate potential for perturbation-based balance training in COPD.Methods: 12 participants with COPD undergoing inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation and 12 age-gender-matched healthy control participants walked on an instrumented treadmill and experienced repeated treadmill-belt ac-celeration perturbations (leading to a forward balance loss). Three-dimensional motion capture was used to quantify the stability of participants body position during perturbed walking. Feasibility, stability following the initial perturbations and adaptation to repeated perturbations were assessed.Findings: Using perturbations in this manner was feasible in this population (no harness assists and participants completed the minimum number of perturbations). No clear, specific deficit in reactive walking stability in COPD was found (no significant effects of participant group on stability or recovery step outcomes). There were mixed results for the adaptability outcomes which overall indicated some adaptability to repeated perturbations, but not to the same extent as the healthy control participants.Interpretation: Treadmill-based perturbations during walking are feasible in COPD. COPD does not appear to result in significant deficits in stability following sudden perturbations and patients do demonstrate some adaptability to repeated perturbations. Perturbation-based balance training may be considered for fall prevention in research and practice in people with COPD.",0
Excessive Daytime Sleepiness as a Risk Factor for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea among Public Transport Drivers: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Context: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) due to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is reported to be a major contributor to many road traffic accidents. Lack of awareness and diagnosis of OSA among public transport workers remains a threat to the society.Aims: The primary aim of this study was to assess the risk of OSA among transport drivers of south Kerala using modified Berlin questionnaire. The secondary objective included craniofacial assessment of the high-risk patients identified through the questionnaire using lateral cephalogram.Settings and Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 180 transport drivers of south Kerala.Methods and Material: Modified Berlin questionnaire and limited physical examination [body mass index (kg/m2), neck circumference (cm), waist circumference (cm), hip circumference and waist to hip ratio, blood pressure (mm Hg)] were recorded. The screened subjects were categorized as high-risk snorers and low-risk snorers based on modified Berlin questionnaire. Craniofacial morphological variations of high-risk group were assessed by lateral cephalograms.Statistical Analysis Used: The descriptive statistics were represented as mean and standard deviation and percentage. Inter-group comparison was performed with independent sample t test.Results: The study demonstrated 64.4% of subjects were non-snorers and 35.6% were snorers. Furthermore, among the snorers, 46.9% were identified as high-risk snorers, whereas the remaining 53.1% represented low-risk snorers.Conclusions: The study revealed the concealed risk of OSA among transport drivers could be screened through the questionnaires and demographics assessment. The application of the proposed screening protocol would triage and enhance safety of OSA affected transport drivers.",1
High-throughput behavioral phenotyping in the expanded panel of BXD recombinant inbred strains,"Genetic reference populations, particularly the BXD recombinant inbred (BXD RI) strains derived from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, are a valuable resource for the discovery of the bio-molecular substrates and genetic drivers responsible for trait variation and covariation. This approach can be profitably applied in the analysis of susceptibility and mechanisms of drug and alcohol use disorders for which many predisposing behaviors may predict the occurrence and manifestation of increased preference for these substances. Many of these traits are modeled by common mouse behavioral assays, facilitating the detection of patterns and sources of genetic coregulation of predisposing phenotypes and substance consumption. Members of the Tennessee Mouse Genome Consortium (TMGC) have obtained phenotype data from over 250 measures related to multiple behavioral assays across several batteries: response to, and withdrawal from cocaine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; ecstasy (MDMA), morphine and alcohol; novelty seeking; behavioral despair and related neurological phenomena; pain sensitivity; stress sensitivity; anxiety; hyperactivity and sleep/wake cycles. All traits have been measured in both sexes in approximately 70 strains of the recently expanded panel of BXD RI strains. Sex differences and heritability estimates were obtained for each trait, and a comparison of early (N = 32) and recent (N = 37) BXD RI lines was performed. Primary data are publicly available for heritability, sex difference and genetic analyses using the MouseTrack database, and are also available in GeneNetwork.org for quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection and genetic analysis of gene expression. Together with the results of related studies, these data form a public resource for integrative systems genetic analysis of neurobehavioral traits.",0
Contact Versus Noncontact Detection of Driver's Drowsiness,"With an estimated number of injuries in the millions, accidents caused due to drowsy driving remain a significant source of financial costs and loss of life. Accurate detection of driver's drowsiness could provide a clear avenue towards eliminating a great majority of the associated accidents and losses. Existing research on the subject could be defined as either contact-based or noncontact-based alertness detection. This paper utilizes a novel multimodal driver's alertness dataset consisting of 45 subjects via seven recorded channels, including four contact-based and three noncontact-based channels, to investigate the performance of said modalities in detecting driver's drowsiness as well as provide a novel comparison between the results of multiple contact and noncontact methods. Our results highlight the viability of noncontact methods to detect driver's drowsiness as an implementable technology in automobiles.",1
Napping on the Night Shift: A Two-Hospital Implementation Project,"Background: Nurses who work the night shift often experience high levels of sleepiness. Napping has been adopted as an effective countermeasure to sleepiness and fatigue in other safety-sensitive industries, but has not had widespread acceptance in nursing.Purpose: To assess the barriers to successful implementation of night-shift naps and to describe the nap experiences of night-shift nurses who took naps.Methods: In this two-hospital pilot implementation project, napping on the night shift was offered to six nursing units for which the executive nursing leadership had given approval. Unit nurse managers' approval was sought, and where granted, further explanation was given to the unit's staff nurses. A nap experience form, which included the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, was used to assess pre-nap sleepiness level, nap duration and perceived sleep experience, post-nap sleep inertia, and the perceived helpfulness of the nap. Nurse managers and staff nurses were also interviewed at the end of the three-month study period.Results: Successful implementation occurred on only one of the six units, with partial success seen on a second unit. Barriers primarily occurred at the point of seeking the unit nurse managers' approval. On the successful unit, 153 30-minutes naps were taken during the study period. A high level of sleepiness was present at the beginning of 44% of the naps. For more than half the naps, nurses reported achieving either light (43%) or deep (14%) sleep. Sleep inertia was rare. The average score of helpfulness of napping was high (7.3 on a 1-to-10 scale). Nurses who napped reported being less drowsy while driving home after their shift.Conclusion: These data suggest that when barriers to napping are overcome, napping on the night shift is feasible and can reduce nurses' workplace sleepiness and drowsy driving on the way home. Addressing nurse managers' perceptions of and concerns about napping may be essential to successful implementation.",0
The Healthy Lifestyle Habits Screening Questionnaire: A pilot study in the Canary Islands,"Objective: This study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of a self-administered screening questionnaire to detect deficiencies in the health habits of the adult population of the Canary Islands (Spain).Design: The questionnaire initially included 30 items based on previous questionnaires and following the recommendations of the World Health Organization about healthy and unhealthy diet, screen time, physical activity, and sleep habits. It also included a section related to hygiene due to the importance that hygienic habits have in people's health.Setting: The questionnaire was self-administered online.Participants: Data was collected from 401 participants from the Canary Islands (age range: 18-73 years) who volunteered to fill in the questionnaire online.Results: The questionnaire revealed adequate overall reliability indexes (Cronbach's alpha > .70, Mcdonald's omega >.70), and construct validity. Hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed age, sex, and income to be significantly (p <.05) related to adults' health lifestyle habits in our population, sex and age explaining the majority of the variance. However, education and incomes were found non-significant (p >.05) when education was introduced into the model. Those results pointed out that older people and women show healthier lifestyle habits.Conclusion: The questionnaire proved to be a brief, reliable, and valid tool to assess health lifestyle habits in adults in the Canary Islands. Furthermore, results pointed out that in future intervention studies with children, variables such as adults' sex, age, and, to a lesser extent, monthly income should be taken into consideration.

Internet of medical things for smart D3S to enable road safety,"It has been seen that most of the accidents occur due to driver's fatigue. Drowsiness is a state of mind before the driver falls asleep, which means the driver could not accomplish his actions, such as vehicular braking, controlling vehicular motion, properly. We have built an Internet of things-based medical application to analyze driver's drowsiness. An architecture has been proposed and a simulation of that scenario in NS3 WSN simulation tool has been done. This simulation shows that the ratio of accidents can be majorly reduced. When drowsiness of drivers is captured, a message alert is delivered to all other drivers of the vehicles that are near to the sleeping driver; for this, different sensor nodes are used. Another unique feature of the sensor network used here is the collaborative effect of sensor nodes. So for measurement and analysis of applications on Google Play, a dataset of the medical applications category was scraped. The scraping was done with 550 applications of each category of medical applications. On each application on Google Play store, almost 70 attributes for each category were scraped. It is envisioned that, in future, wireless sensor networks will be an integral part of our lives, more so than the present-day personal computers.",1
"Comparison of cognitive behaviour therapy versus activity management, both delivered remotely, to treat paediatric chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis: the UK FITNET-NHS RCT","Design: Parallel-group randomised controlled trial. Methods: Participants:Adolescents aged 11-17 years, diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and with no local specialist treatment centre, were referred to a specialist service in South West England. Interventions:Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service is a web-based myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy programme for adolescents, supported by individualised written, asynchronous electronic consultations with a clinical psychologist/cognitive-behavioural therapy practitioner. The comparator was videocall-delivered activity management with a myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome clinician. Both treatments were intended to last 6 months. Objectives:Estimate the effectiveness of Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service compared to Activity Management for paediatric myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Estimate the effectiveness of Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service compared to Activity Management for those with mild/moderate comorbid mood disorders. From a National Health Service perspective, estimate the cost-effectiveness of Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service compared to Activity Management over a 12-month horizon.Primary Outcome:36-item Short Form Health Survey Physical Function subscale at 6 months post randomisation.Randomisation:Web-based, using minimisation with a random component to balance allocated groups by age and gender.Blinding:While the investigators were blinded to group assignment, this was not possible for participants, parents/carers and therapists.Results: The treatment of 314 adolescents was randomly allocated, 155 to Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service. Mean age was 14 years old and 63% were female.Primary outcome: At 6 months, participants allocated to Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service were more likely to have improved physical function (mean 60.5, standard deviation 29.5, n = 127) compared to Activity Management (mean 50.3, standard deviation 26.5, n = 138). The mean difference was 8.2 (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 13.6, p = 0.003). The result was similar for participants meeting the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2021 diagnostic criteria.Secondary outcomes: Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service participants attended, on average, half a day more school per week at 6 months than those allocated Activity Management, and this difference was maintained at 12 months. There was no strong evidence that comorbid mood disorder impacted upon the relative effectiveness of the two interventions. Similar improvement was seen in the two groups for pain and the Clinical Global Impression scale, with a mixed picture for fatigue. Both groups continued to improve, and no clear difference in physical function remained at 12 months [difference in means 4.4 (95% confidence interval -1.7 to 10.5)].One or more of the pre-defined measures of a worsening condition in participants during treatment, combining therapist and patient reports, were met by 39 (25%) participants in the Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service group and 42 (26%) participants in the Activity Management group.A small gain was observed for the Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service group compared to Activity Management in quality-adjusted life-years (0.002, 95% confidence interval -0.041 to 0.045). From an National Health Service perspective, the costs were 1047.51 pound greater in the Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service group (95% confidence interval 624.61 pound to 1470.41) pound. At a base cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 457,721 pound with incremental net benefit of -1001 pound (95% confidence interval -2041 pound to 38) pound. Conclusion: At 6 months post randomisation, compared with Activity Management, Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service improved physical function and school attendance. The additional cost of Fatigue In Teenagers on the interNET in the National Health Service and limited sustained impact mean it is unlikely to be cost-effective.

"The effects of 37 hours of continuous wakefulness on the physiological arousal, cognitive performance, self-reported mood, and simulator flight performance of F-117A pilots","Pilot fatigue poses a serious threat to operational safety, but understanding the nature of the problem and the times at which pilots are most at risk will facilitate operationally relevant fatigue-management strategies. This investigation sought to address these issues in a controlled investigation of the impact of sustained wakefulness on Air Force aviators. Ten current and qualified F-I 17 pilots completed the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), a resting eyes-open and eyes-closed EEG, and a standardized flight evaluation in an F-117 flight simulator at 5-hr intervals during the final 23 hours of a 37-hr period of continuous wakefulness. Results indicated significant decrements in mood, cognition, central nervous system activation, and flight skills began to occur in the predawn hours during a night without sleep. However, the most serious operationally relevant decrements appeared at approximately 0700 (after 25 hours without sleep) and persisted throughout the remainder of the deprivation period. The decrements suggested in the real world crew coordination likely will decline, information processing will become impaired, and a wide array of basic capabilities will be degraded as a result of compromised vigilance, poor situational awareness, and sluggish reaction time. Even the well-practiced flight skills of experienced pilots are clearly susceptible to the insidious effects of sleep loss. These quantified effects of untreated sleep deprivation will provide a baseline against which promising fatigue countermeasures can be assessed.",1
Treating Electrical and Biopotential Artifacts in an EEG Pilot Study Experiment,"With the increase in life expectancy, as well as in the performance and complexity of healthcare systems, the need for fast and accurate information has also grown. EEG devices have become more accessible and necessary in clinical practice. In daily activity, artifacts are ubiquitous in EEG signals. They arise from: environmental, experimental and physiological factors, degrade signal quality and render the affected part of the signal useless. This paper proposes an artifact cleaning pipeline including filters and algorithms to streamline the analysis process. Moreover, to better characterize and discriminate artifacts from useful EEG data, additional physiological signals and video data are used, which are correlated with subject's behavior. We quantify the performance reached by Peak Signalto-Noise Ratio and clinical visual inspection. The entire research and data collection took place in the laboratories of XPERI Corporation.",0
An interval type-2 fuzzy SLIM approach to predict human error in maritime transportation,"The human factor is regarded as one of the most significant topics for sustainable maritime transportation since increasing shipping activities can pose potential hazards to human life, the environment, and commodity. The paper aims to assess the potential contribution of human errors in the maritime industry. Hence, Success Likelihood Index Method (SLIM) was employed by incorporating interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs). While SLIM systematically estimates human error probability (HEP) for the designated task, IT2FS deals with subjectivity in the process of using experts' judgements. A loading operation onboard containership was investigated due to its considerable risks for the marine environment. Safety culture, experience, fatigue, and time limitation were observed as highly effective on crew performance. The obtained results indicate that the IT2FS-SLIM approach can effectively be applied for determining the vulnerabilities and critical human errors in the operational process. The paper is also intended to enhance safety control levels and minimize potential errors in maritime transportation.",0
Machine Learning Systems for Detecting Driver Drowsiness,"Drowsy driver detection is one of the potential applications of intelligent vehicle systems. Previous approaches to drowsiness detection primarily make pre-assumptions about the relevant behavior, focusing on blink rate, eye closure, and yawning. Here we employ machine learning to datamine actual human behavior during drowsiness episodes. Automatic classifiers for 30 facial actions from the Facial action coding system were developed using machine learning on a separate database of spontaneous expressions. These facial actions include blinking and yawn motions, as well as a number of other facial movements. These measures were passed to learning-based classifiers such as Adaboost and multinomial ridge regression. Head motion information was collected through automatic eye tracking and an accelerometer. The system was able to predict sleep and crash episodes on a simulator with 98% accuracy across subjects. It is the highest prediction rate reported to date for detecting drowsiness. Moreover, the analysis revealed new information about human facial behavior for drowsy drivers.",1
Robotic denudation of zygotes,"The vitrification technology is used in the embryo freezing process. To ensure intracellular water removal and avoid ice crystal formation, the cumulus cells surrounding zygotes need to be removed. As operators have varying skill and long-time fatigue, it is challenging to completely remove the cumulus cells surrounding zygotes and reduce zygote loss inside the micropipette. The objective of this work is to develop a robotic zygote denudation system for the vitrification procedure. The robotic system enables accurate segmentation of cumulus cells for estimating the mass of cumulus zygote complexes (CZCs) inside the micropipette via the Res-Unet neural network. A mathematical model was built to describe the dynamic motion of CZCs inside the micropipette, and a model-based optimal controller was developed to aspirate and deposit CZCs inside the micropipette. To denude zygote completely, the Res-Attention neural network was used to detect cumulus cells for predicting the quality of zygote denudation. In the mouse zygotes experiments, the yield rate is 98.2%+/- 1.6% and the denudation efficacy is 96.9%+/- 0.2% for the robotic system. Compared with manual denudation, the survival rate and development rate of embryos cultured from zygotes denuded by the robotic system were both higher in subsequent vitrification procedure.",0
Neural processing of biomedical data for improving driving safety,"Driving ability can be impaired by fatigue, drowsiness, drugs and alcohol, all of which have been implicated in causing road traffic accidents. Acute hypoglycaemia, which is the most common side effect of insulin therapy in individuals with diabetes, may also compromise driving skills. Other than by forbidding people to drive, the potential danger can be reduced by monitoring health and consciousness of drivers, by providing them with feedback on their conditions using, eventually, an emergency centre or biofeedback. In this paper, we propose the use of a signal processing system based on neural networks for system modelling and prediction. In particular, using neural networks we will reproduce the glucose temporal evolution without invasive technique for drivers, with the aim of preventing loss of consciousness while driving and hence improving road safety. Some illustrative trials will be shown in this regard. This research work is supported by the CTL Excellence Centre (Centro di Ricerca sul Trasporto e la Logistica) co-funded by the Italian Ministry of University, Education and Research and by the University of Rome La Sapienza.",0
Technological Evolution in the Swiss Bus Fleet from 1940 to 2022: An Inventory and Database for Research Applications,"(1) Background: A strategic approach to managing and evolving the bus fleet is essential for optimizing public transportation, improving service efficiency, meeting future demands, and incorporating environmentally friendly technologies. However, country-specific data on fleet composition and evolution are often lacking despite their importance in evaluating technological impacts on the environment, passenger comfort, and driver working conditions. This report describes the creation of the inventory of the Swiss bus fleet and analyzes technological developments in bus vehicles from 1940 to 2022. (2) Methods: We collected the data through a comprehensive mapping study and validated it with Swiss bus companies and experts from the Federal Office of Transport. Vehicle approval forms were used to extract technical data. Buses were sorted by brand and model. For each bus model, 58 technical characteristics were documented in a database. A latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to classify the buses according to their technological characteristics. (3) Results: The inventory comprises 891 bus models, classified into four groups representing different generations. The predominance of thermal buses and the emergence of hybrid and electric buses since 2010 were noticed. (4) Conclusion: This inventory tracks bus technology evolution and highlights potential implications for driver occupational exposure and environmental impact assessment.",0
Sleeping for two: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in pregnant women,"Background Insomnia and sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and have potentially significant consequences for both maternal and infant health. There is limited research examining the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) during pregnancy. With increased distress and limited access to services during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also an unprecedented need for telehealth delivery of treatment programs for pregnant women. The aims of this trial are to evaluate the impact of the Sleeping for Two adaptation of CBT-I in pregnancy (in-person or telehealth) versus treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing symptoms of insomnia (primary outcome), as well as increasing gestational length and reducing symptoms of depression (secondary outcomes).Methods A two-arm, single-blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the impact of CBT-I compared to TAU among a sample of 62 pregnant women, enrolled between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation, who self-identify as experiencing insomnia. Five weekly individual sessions of CBT-I will be delivered in person or via telehealth depending on physical distancing guidelines. Assessment of insomnia diagnosis by structured interview, self-reported insomnia symptom severity and sleep problems, and sleep quantity and quality as measured by a daily diary and actigraphy will occur at 12-28 weeks of pregnancy (T1), 1 week post-treatment (T2), and 6 months postpartum (T3).Discussion CBT-I delivered in pregnancy has the potential to reduce symptoms of insomnia and depression and could lead to reduced risk of preterm birth, all of which can minimize risk of negative maternal and child health and developmental consequences in the short (e.g., infant death) and long terms (e.g., developmental delays). This RCT builds on a successful open pilot trial conducted by our team and will provide further evaluation of a novel evidence-based treatment for pregnancy-related insomnia, which can be widely disseminated and used to treat individuals that are most in need of intervention. Findings will enhance understanding of pregnancy-related sleep problems, as well as means by which to improve the health and sleep of mothers and their children.",0
Cannabinoids and bladder symptoms in multiple sclerosis,"Background: Research on the health benefits of cannabis has been limited because use remains restricted or illegal in most countries. Medical cannabis has been legal in Canada since 2001 and recreational use became legal in October 2018. While there are data that support a biological mechanism by which cannabinoids can impact various other symptoms of MS, the evidence of effectiveness of cannabis as a treatment for bladder symptoms remains unsettled. We conducted an exploratory study to describe the current trends of cannabis product consumption among people with MS (PwMS) and their association with perceived benefits on MS symptoms. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study of PwMS, recruited from the MS Clinic in Calgary, Alberta, Canada was undertaken. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between cannabis consumption and improvement in bladder function symptoms. Results: There were 775 respondents out of 2899 PwMS contacted by email. Among respondents, 734 reported cannabis use in the past 3 months. There were 275 (37.5%) respondents who reported cannabis use in the prior 3 months, and 73.8% of these reported at least weekly use of cannabis. Among all users, 78.1% reported a primary medical or therapeutic indication for consumption. The most common modes of cannabis consumption were oraledible (69.0%) and smoked (57.1%), while 59.3% used more than one mode of consumption and 2.6% used five different modes. The most common reasons for cannabis use were for sleep (58.3%), pain (51.5%), relaxation (44.4%), muscle spasms (40.2%), anxiety (33.8%) and depression (22.9%). Among the 19 participants who reported bladder symptoms as a main reason for cannabis use, 89.5% reported better bladder symptoms when using cannabis. Cannabis consumption in the past 3 months was associated with a two-fold increased odds of reporting improvement in urinary frequency, urinary urgency, bladder leakage and wetness, pad use and bladder emptying. Conclusions: Cannabis is commonly used in this survey study of personal cannabis use among PwMS. Patterns of use, dosing, frequency and mode of delivery are diverse among survey respondents. This pilot study provides some initial glimpses into real world therapeutic use of cannabinoids among PwMS for bladder symptoms.",0
A Visual-Based Driver Distraction Recognition and Detection Using Random Forest,"Driver distraction and fatigue are considered the main cause of most car accidents today. This paper compares the performance of Random Forest and a number of other well-known classifiers for driver distraction detection and recognition problems. A non-intrusive system, which consists of hardware components for capturing the driver's driving sessions on a car simulator, using infrared and Kinect cameras, combined with a software component for monitoring some visual behaviors that reflect a driver's level of distraction, was used in this work.In this system, five visual cues were calculated: arm position, eye closure, eye gaze, facial expressions, and orientation. These cues were then fed into a classifier, such as AdaBoost, Hidden Markov Models, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Conditional Random Field, or Neural Network, in order to detect and recognize the type of distraction. The use of various cues resulted in a more robust and accurate detection and classification of distraction, than using only one. The system was tested with various sequences recorded from different users. Experimental results were very promising, and show the superiority of the Random Forest classifier compared to the other classifiers.",1
IoT-Based Monitoring System for Safe Driving,"Several studies are made on both physiological and psychological states of the driver. With the increase in the technology in today's world lead to the development of new devices. Driving is a complex activity that requires multi-level skills. Most of our driving skills will be improved by experience. Many people lost and even losing their lives because of this distracted, drunken, and rash driving due to lack of proper system. The main purpose of the IoT project is to design a system which will detect the drunken and drowsiness of the driver and provide safety by controlling the speed of the vehicle. GSM technology is used to alert the owner in case of drunken driving. Smart controlling of the headlight brightness is also involved in the project.",1
The study of Driver Fatigue Monitor Algorithm Based on Skin Color Segmentation,"In this paper, the kind of driver fatigue monitor algorithm is studied based on color image skin color segment, which directly transforms the RGB form image to the gradation image by the skin color segmentation, and then the eyes is detected.

The Effect of Beat Frequency Vibration on Sleep Latency and Neural Complexity: A Pilot Study,"Insomnia affects millions of people worldwide, and non-pharmacological treatment options are limited. A bed excited with multiple vibration sources was used to explore beat frequency vibration (BFV) as a non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia. A repeated measures design pilot study of 14 participants with mild-moderate insomnia symptom severity (self-reported on the Insomnia Severity Index) was conducted to determine the effects of BFV, and traditional standing wave vibration (SWV) on sleep latency and sleep electrocortical activity. Participants were monitored using high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG). Sleep latency was compared between treatment conditions. A trend of decreasing sleep latency due to BFV was found for unequivocal sleep latency (p <= 0.068). Neural complexity during wake, N1, and N2 stages were compared using Multi-Scale Sample Entropy (MSE), which demonstrated significantly lower MSE between wake and N2 stages (p <= 0.002). During N2 sleep, BFV showed lower MSE than the control session in the left frontoparietal region. As a measure of information integration, reduced entropy may indicate that BFV decreases conscious awareness during deeper stages of sleep. SWV caused reduced alpha activity and increased delta activity during wake. BFV caused increased delta activity during N2 sleep. These preliminary results suggest that BFV may help decrease sleep latency, reduce conscious awareness, and increase sleep drive expression during deeper stages of sleep. SWV may be beneficial for decreasing expression of arousal and increasing expression of sleep drive during wake, implying that beat frequency vibration may be beneficial to sleep.",0
Influence of repeated maximal exercise testing on biomarkers and fatigue in sarcoidosis,"Fatigue in the immune mediated inflammatory disease sarcoidosis is thought to be associated with impaired exercise tolerance. This prospective study assessed fatigue and recuperative capacity after repeated exercise, and examined whether changing concentrations in biomarkers upon exercise are associated with fatigue.Twenty sarcoidosis patients and 10 healthy volunteers performed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests on two successive days. Concentrations of cytokines, stress hormones, ACE and CM were assessed before and after the two exercise tests, and 3 days thereafter. All participants completed a sleep diary.Severely fatigued patients showed significant lower VO2 max (p = 0.038, p = 0.022) and maximal workload (p = 0.034, p = 0.028) on both exercise tests compared to healthy controls. No impairment of maximal exercise testing was demonstrated during the second cycling test in any group. Fatigue was not correlated with changes in concentrations of biomarkers upon exercise. Severely fatigued patients rated both tests as significantly more fatiguing, and reported significant lower mean subjective night sleeping time during the testing period.Fatigue in sarcoidosis patients cannot be objectified by reduction of exercise capacity after repeated maximal exercise testing, and is not correlated with significant changes in biomarkers. Severe fatigue is only and consistently featured by patient reported outcomes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin for Treatment of Compensated Recurrent Hepatitis C Virus Infection After Liver Transplantation,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Interferon alfa-based regimens used to treat recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after liver transplantation are poorly tolerated, associated with generally modest efficacy, and can interact with immunosuppressive agents. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of an interferon-free regimen of the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir combined with ribavirin for 24 weeks in treating post-transplantation HCV infection. METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter, open-label pilot study, we enrolled patients with compensated recurrent HCV infection of any genotype after a primary or secondary liver transplantation. All patients received 24 weeks of sofosbuvir 400 mg daily and ribavirin starting at 400 mg daily, which was adjusted according to creatinine clearance and hemoglobin values. The primary end point was sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients enrolled and treated, 78% were male, 85% were white, 83% had HCV genotype 1, 40% had cirrhosis (based on biopsy), and 88% had been previously treated with interferon. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment was achieved by 28 of 40 patients (70%; 90% confidence interval: 56%-82%). Relapse accounted for all cases of virologic failure. No patients had detectable viral resistance during or after treatment. The most common adverse events were fatigue (30%), diarrhea (28%), and headache (25%). In addition, 20% of the subjects experienced anemia. Two patients discontinued study treatment because of adverse events, which were considered unrelated to study treatment. No deaths, graft losses, or episodes of rejection occurred. No interactions with any concomitant immunosuppressive agents were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Sofosbuvir and ribavirin combination therapy for 24 weeks is an effective and well-tolerated interferon-free treatment for post-transplantation HCV infection.

Treating sleep disturbances in refugees and asylum seekers: results from a randomized controlled pilot trial evaluating the STARS group intervention,"Background: Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in traumatized refugees and often persist despite treatment, and adapted scalable interventions are needed. The group intervention 'Sleep Training adapted for Refugees' (STARS) is a culturally- and context-sensitive approach based on evidence-based treatments for sleep disturbances (e.g. CBT-I, IRT). This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of STARS. Method: A randomized-controlled trial (STARS vs. waitlist) with 47 young male Afghan refugees was conducted in a routine clinical setting (DRKS-ID: DRKS00024419) with pre-, post- and 3-month follow-up assessments. The primary outcome was insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index); secondary outcomes included PTSD, anxiety and depression symptoms, nightmares, coping with nightmares, fear of sleep, selected sleep diary measures, and quality of life. The data were analysed using mixed models. Results: Adherence to STARS was high (dropout = 17.4%, average attended sessions = 77%) as was client satisfaction (MCSQ-4 = 12.74, SDCSQ-4 = 2.08). A medium to large significant effect of time was observed for insomnia severity (d = 0.96) and most secondary measures (except nightmares and fear of sleep). However, there was no significant interaction with condition at post-treatment for the primary outcome (d = 0.29) and most secondary outcomes; the only exceptions were increased coping with nightmares, decreased daytime sleep, and time in bed. Conclusions: STARS appears feasible for treating sleep disturbances in traumatized refugees in a routine clinical setting, showing moderate to large within-group effects. However, it was not superior to the waitlist, likely due to unexpected improvements in the waitlist group. Adjustments to STARS may enhance its efficacy. Further research is needed to determine how STARS can be a scalable add-on treatment for sleep disturbances in traumatized refugees and asylum seekers.",0
Safety of Vinflunine in Patients with Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma Refractory to Platinum-based Chemotherapy: A Prospective Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND: Several single chemotherapeutic agents have been evaluated as the second-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma. Despite encouraging efficacy outcomes, toxicity has often led to dose modifications or discontinuation. We aimed to assess the safety of vinflunine in a particular population of advanced transitional cell carcinoma of urothelium (TCCU), that were exposed to the previous toxicity of chemotherapy.METHODS: This is an open-label, prospective, single-center pilot study to evaluate the response rate and safety profile of vinflunine in patients with advanced TCCU. It was planned to enroll 25 evaluable patients. Eligible patients are those with progressive disease after first-line platinum-based regimen for advanced or metastatic disease.RESULTS: The study was prematurely closed due to two sudden deaths that were judged by the review board as treatment-related. Only ten patients were evaluated and received at least one cycle of vinflunine. All but one were male and seven underwent radical surgery. Eight had a distant metastasis (mainly lung and/or liver). Disease control rate was 40%, four patients had a partial response with median duration of response of 3.5 months. The median overall survival was 3.2 months (95% CI:1.67- 4.73). There were three serious adverse events namely two sudden deaths and one grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Nine grade 3/4 adverse events occurred. The most common all-grade adverse events were fatigue (50%), constipation (40%) and vomiting (40%). Moreover, grade 3 fatigue occurred in 30% of patients. Only one patient, who achieved PR for 5 months, was fit to receive further cytotoxic chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: The activity of vinflunine in advanced urothelial carcinoma came at the expense of its safety. The use of vinflunine has to be limited to the selected group of patients. However, this is a single institute experience in a limited number of patients.",0
Levocetirizine in persistent allergic rhinitis: continuous or on-demand use? A pilot study,"Background: Allergic rhinitis is a high-prevalence disease that affects quality of life (QOL), sleep quality and productivity of patients. According to the ARIA initiative, it is classified as intermittent and persistent, the latter being the most troublesome.Methods: The aim of this randomized, open-label, 6-month, pilot study was to determine whether levocetirizine 5 mg administered continuously once daily in the morning was better than levocetirizine 5 mg on-demand in symptomatic subjects with persistent allergic rhinitis. Total and individual symptom scores were recorded in a diary card throughout the study. QOL, quality of sleep, nasal cytology, rate of drug intake, and safety were also assessed at pre-defined time-points.Results: In all, adult patients (31 in each group) were enrolled, of whom 22 dropped out. Both treatment regimens considerably decreased the total and individual symptoms scores from baseline and achieved similar levels up to week 14. Continuous treatment was generally better than on-demand from week 15 onwards, reaching statistical significance from weeks 17 to 21 (from week 19 to 21 for nasal pruritus). Both regimens substantially improved QOL and sleep quality. Both treatments were well tolerated, although the on-demand group reported more adverse events.Conclusion: The present open label study in 62 patients indicates that levocetirizine 5 mg reliably controls persistent rhinitis over a period of 6 months, and shows a trend to be more effective in controlling the symptoms of rhinitis, improving QOL and decreasing nasal inflammation, when administered as long-term continuous therapy rather than as on-demand therapy.",0
Research on the detection method of driver fatigue based on Mahalanobis Distance,"In the world, the driver fatigue detection method has become a hotspot. Reduce driver fatigue is one of the key factors to ensure road traffic safety. It is important to reduce traffic accidents. In this paper, by monitoring and collection of the driver's pulse, heart rate and other physiological signal, the correlation between the physiological signals and driver fatigue can be find out. So the model of fatigue characteristics can be established. By the principal component analysis (PCA), the weight of the fatigue characteristics is determined. The criteria for driver fatigue can be established through the method of Mahalanobis distance. It can provides a practical approach for the effective monitoring of driver fatigue conditions.",1
The interrater reliability of dynamic leap and balance test in healthy and chronic ankle instability,"The primary aim of this study was to assess the interrater reliability of the Dynamic Leap and Balance Test (DLBT) in chronic ankle instability (CAI) and healthy groups. The secondary aim was to assess the differences in errors and time taken to complete the DLBT between the two groups for both raters and to identify cutoff scores to distinguish between patients with CAI and healthy controls. This was a controlled laboratory reliability analysis study. Fourteen healthy college-aged subjects (9 women 5 men; weight = 62.10 +/- 8.03; height = 168.35 +/- 6.0) and sixteen with a history of CAI (9 women, 7 men; weight = 68.01 +/- 10.74; height = 172.08 +/- 11.37) participated. Interrater reliability was determined by independent raters for both total time taken to complete the task and errors made. The most optimal score to discriminate between two groups was determined by receiver operator curve analysis. Total time taken and errors made were also documented for group differences as secondary analysis. A strong agreement was found between the two raters for time and errors with intraclass correlation coefficient >0.80. Significantly (P < .05) higher number of errors were made and greater time taken by the CAI subjects when compared with healthy for both raters. The most optimal score to discriminate between CAI and healthy control was 43.28s and 4 errors. Excellent interrater reliability substantiates that it can be used confidently by different clinicians for testing dynamic balance. CAI group took more time and made more errors to complete the DLBT.",0
Real-time full-field ultrasonic inspection of composites using acoustography,"Many small composite parts undergo manual pulse-echo scan because 1) the set-up time for and automated scan is unjustifiably long and 2) the automated scan does not provide the flexibility to cope with frequent angle changes in a complex geometry part. Manual scans can be time consuming, laborious, and are prone to errors due to operator fatigue and subjectivity. What is required is a full-field ultrasonic inspection system analogous to real time radiography that allows the operator to perform ultrasonic inspection by manipulating the part under a systems field of view. In this paper, we will present an acoustography-based ultrasonic inspection system developed under a SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) award that is bringing this vision to into reality. Acoustography is the ultrasonic analog of radiography and photography. A unique, wide area 2D detector, called acousto-optic (AO) sensor, is used to directly convert ultrasound into visual images; much like a fluorescent screen is able to convert x-rays into visual images. It offers the potential for providing the NDT engineer with a large field of view (e.g. 6x6 or larger) and a capability to inspect complex shaped parts in real time.",0
Ortho-parasympathetic balance changes after aerobatics flights,"Objectives - Study was the ortho-parasympathetic balance changes assessment after an aerobatics flight (called push-pull).Conclusion - Post flight fatigue of the autonomic nervous system involved by the push-pull accelerations was expressed by changes of the resting ortho-parasympathetic balance.Protocol - Five pilots performed a training flight of 30 minutes with 5 series of 30 seconds of spirals down under negative acceleration (-3 Gz; -4 Gz) followed by 30 seconds of spirals down under positive acceleration (+3 Gz; +4 Gz). Between each series, pilots carried off a flat flight. A stand-test (10 minutes fall flat on the ground, 10 minutes stand up) was realised before flight, 5 minutes after landing, I et 2 hours after flight. Electrocardiogram was recorded during the stand-test with an analogical device). Blood pressure was recorded with an automatic monitor.Results - Spectral analysis of resting heart rate variability and blood pressure variability recorded during stand-tests revealed a continuous disturbance of the ortho-parasympathetic balance after flight probably related to the disturbance of the baroreflexe control. Indeed the compared evolutions of heart rate and blood pressure variability before versus after flight showed an increase in sympathetic tone just after flight and an increase in parasympathetic tone during 2 hours after flight.

The Method of Eyes Status Identification Based on the Characteristics Analysis,"Degree of driver fatigue test needs to achieve accurate and real-time eyes status identification, for this reason proposed an effective method based on the human eyes' characteristics analysis of status identification. Using the Hough transform to detect human iris, setting threshold by experimental analysis to obtain the iris of threshold requirement, judge eye open and close condition. When the method can not detect characteristics of iris, adopting horizontal gray-level projection method for further integration. In VPM hardware platform, using C language to program experiment for the algorithm, experimental results show that this method can detect eyes open and close condition accurately and timely.",1
"Relationship between sleep disorders, HIV status and cardiovascular risk: cross-sectional study of long-haul truck drivers from Southern Africa","ObjectivesLong-haul truck drivers (TDs) may have lifestyles that promote cardiovascular disease (CVD), including diet, sleep and activity issues. Most studies conducted among truckers investigated the relationship between poor sleep and cardiometabolic health, but none assessed whether suspected obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and shortened sleep were associated with markers of cardiometabolic risk. We determined whether sleep disorders and circadian misalignment were associated with chronic inflammation and CVD risk in TDs from Southern Africa.MethodsParticipants were recruited at roadside wellness centres in Gauteng and Free State Provinces, South Africa. OSA risk was assessed using the Berlin Questionnaire, while sleep duration and sleep quality were assessed using items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Clinical information, neck circumference (NC), metabolic profile, elevated BP, HIV status and C-reactive protein (CRP) were collected. CVD risk was assessed using the Framingham Risk Score (FRS).ResultsOut of 575 participants aged on average 37.7 years, 17.2% were at OSA risk, 72.0% had elevated BP, 9.4% had HIV and 28.0% were obese. Mean sleep duration was 7.4 +/- 1.8 hours, and 49.6% reported working night shift at least once a week. Shortened sleep, OSA risk, age, body mass index, NC and years as full-time TD were associated with greater FRS independently of HIV status and night shift. Working night shift was associated with higher CRP levels in HIV+ compared with HIV- participants.ConclusionsCircadian misalignment in HIV, and OSA and short sleep duration in all truckers were associated with increased CVD risk. Truckers should be given careful attention in terms of health management and sleep education.",0
Sleep macro-architecture in patients with Parkinson's disease does not change during the first night of neurostimulation in a pilot study,"Study Objectives: A growing body of literature suggests that deep brain stimulation to treat motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease may also ameliorate certain sleep deficits. Many foundational studies have examined the impact of stimulation on sleep following several months of therapy, leaving an open question regarding the time course for improvement. It is unknown whether sleep improvement will immediately follow onset of therapy or accrete over a prolonged period of stimulation. The objective of our study was to address this knowledge gap by assessing the impact of deep brain stimulation on sleep macro-architecture during the first nights of stimulation. Methods: Polysomnograms were recorded for 3 consecutive nights in 14 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (10 male, 4 female; age: 53-74 years), with intermittent, unilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation on the final night or 2. Sleep scoring was determined manually by a consensus of 4 experts. Sleep macro-architecture was objectively quantified using the percentage, latency, and mean bout length of wake after sleep onset and on each stage of sleep (rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement stages 1, 2, 3). Results: Sleep was found to be highly disrupted in all nights. Sleep architecture on nights without stimulation was consistent with prior results in treatment naive patients with Parkinson's disease. No statistically significant difference was observed due to stimulation. Conclusions: These objective measures suggest that 1 night of intermittent subthreshold stimulation appears insufficient to impact sleep macro-architecture.

Effect of deep brain stimulation on the severity of seizures and the quality of life in patients with multifocal drug-resistant epilepsy in Iran: A pilot review of local experience.,"This study investigates the impact of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus deep brain stimulation (ANT-DBS) on patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) in Iran, specifically focusing on its effects on seizure metrics, severity and its influence on quality of life over time. A cohort of eight patients with DRE in Iran who underwent ANT-DBS was evaluated. Pre-operative assessments included comprehensive documentation of seizure frequency, duration, severity scores, and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-13). Each patient also underwent high-resolution imaging using a 1.5 Tesla MRI, with targeted electrode placement in the anterior thalamic area. Post-operative evaluations measured changes in seizure frequency, severity scores, duration, and quality of life indicators. All subjects presented with DRE, and the mean age of participants was 24.62years. Post-operative data revealed significantly reduced seizure frequency, duration, and severity scores. Notably, this reduction was more pronounced at the 6-month follow-up than the 3-month assessment, indicating a progressive therapeutic effect. All patients demonstrated a response to ANT-DBS, with two individuals achieving seizure freedom. Additionally, there was a marked improvement in quality of life, particularly in the domains of energy/fatigue and social functioning. ANT-DBS has been established as a promising and safe therapeutic intervention for patients with DRE. In a cohort of DRE patients in Iran, the treatment demonstrated comparable efficacy in decreasing seizure frequency and severity and enhancing self-reported quality of life, consistent with findings reported in the existing literature. The therapeutic benefits of ANT-DBS appear to augment over time.",0
Development and psychometric properties of the sleep problems and coping with sleep problem scales for pregnant women,"Aims: The aim of this study is to develop a sleep problems scale and a coping with sleep problems scale for pregnant women and assess their reliability and validity.Design: An empirical research quantitative design.Review Methods: Self-reported instruments were developed through (1) item genera-tion, (2) preliminary item evaluation and (3) scale refining and evaluation. Item pools were created via literature review, opinions of experts and women with experience in pregnancy sleep. Content, construct and criterion validities were tested. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, split- half reliability and corrected item- total correlation. Data Sources: Data were collected between January 23 and July 22, 2020, at a hos-pital's obstetrics polyclinic. In the pilot and main study, 30 and 368 pregnant women (gestational age: 8- 42 weeks) were included, respectively.Results: The content validity index was > 0.9 for each scale. Factor analysis showed 24 and 18 items in the two scales, both with four subdimensions. The corrected item-total correlations were acceptable, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.883 and 0.799, respectively.Conclusion: Both scales developed in this study are valid and reliable for the Turkish society.Implications for the profession and/or patient care/global clinical community: This study's findings may prevent the lack of validated screening instruments to identify pregnancy-specific sleep features.Impact: We developed two scales to assess sleep problems in pregnant women. These were valid and reliable, can be routinely used by health professionals and may guide nurses and midwives in assessing and managing sleep problems during pregnancy.Reporting Method: The study conforms to the COSMIN checklist.Patient or Public Contribution: Data were collected during face- to- face surveys. Ten women contributed to the item pool generation, 30 pregnant women participated in the pilot study, and 368 antenatal service users participated in the main study.",0
"A Wellness Program for Cancer Survivors and Caregivers: Developing an Integrative Pilot Program with Exercise, Nutrition, and Complementary Medicine","The Integrative Wellness Program (IWP) at the University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) sought to provide integrative wellness education to cancer patients, survivors, and caregivers by offering instruction in exercise, nutrition, and complementary and alternative medicine. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the IWP on the overall wellness of the individuals participating in the program. Three different 10-week versions of the IWP were conducted over a 1-year period. Each session focused on a different wellness topic presented through interactive lectures and applied activities. A series of self-report questionnaires were administered at baseline and again at the completion of the program to assess improvements in physical activity levels, dietary habits, sleep hygiene, and quality of life. Participants were generally older, Caucasian, female, had higher levels of education, and still currently receiving treatment. Significant changes were observed in two measures: Starting the Conversation (-2.0 +/- 2.40, p = .037) and the Sticking To It subscale of the Self-Efficacy and Eating Habits Survey (1.7 +/- 1.22, p = .0013). A trend for improvement in the Reducing Fat subscale of the Self-Efficacy Eating Habits (0.44 +/- 0.60, p = .056) was also observed. Participant satisfaction surveys indicated high levels of satisfaction and applicability of the material presented. The significant improvements detected related to dietary habits, combined with the responses from the participant satisfaction surveys, suggest that the IWP was well received and can positively impact the overall wellness of cancer patients, survivors, and their caregivers.",0
Innovative Driver Monitoring Systems and On-Board-Vehicle Devices in a Smart-Road Scenario Based on the Internet of Vehicle Paradigm: A Literature and Commercial Solutions Overview,"In recent years, the growing number of vehicles on the road have exacerbated issues related to safety and traffic congestion. However, the advent of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) holds the potential to transform mobility, enhance traffic management and safety, and create smarter, more interconnected road networks. This paper addresses key road safety concerns, focusing on driver condition detection, vehicle monitoring, and traffic and road management. Specifically, various models proposed in the literature for monitoring the driver's health and detecting anomalies, drowsiness, and impairment due to alcohol consumption are illustrated. The paper describes vehicle condition monitoring architectures, including diagnostic solutions for identifying anomalies, malfunctions, and instability while driving on slippery or wet roads. It also covers systems for classifying driving style, as well as tire and emissions monitoring. Moreover, the paper provides a detailed overview of the proposed traffic monitoring and management solutions, along with systems for monitoring road and environmental conditions, including the sensors used and the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented. Finally, this review also presents an overview of innovative commercial solutions, illustrating advanced devices for driver monitoring, vehicle condition assessment, and traffic and road management.",1
"G3 sports supplement in short triathlon: improvements in training, performance, recovery and oxidative stress","BACKGROUND: This registry study evaluated the effects of G3 Sports supplement drink (G3) on performance and endurance in triathlon in amateur athletes in a period of 2 weeks of training. G3 is composed of a proprietary fruit juice blend high in carotenoid compounds as well as 100 mg of standardized French oak (Quercus robur) wood extract, Robuvit (R), per 50 mL bottle. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of the compounds in G3 may improve training efficiency (decreasing post-triathlon muscular pain, cramps and improve recovery time) and decrease post-training plasma free radicals (PFR).METHODS: We selected 50 healthy subjects available to follow the registry plan (age 30-40). No clinical or risk condition were present; no medications were used. Subjects followed a free diet. None used sport supplements (aminoacids or anabolic products). The use of rehydrating drink (Polase) was suggested to all subjects. The only other admitted beverage was Gatorade for use by the control group only. Triathlon total time as well as objective markers of oxidative stress, measured as plasma concentration of free radicals (PFR), and intravascular hemolysis (hemoglobin, serum ferritin, unconjugated bilirubin (UBR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured.RESULTS: Fifty subjects were included: 25 using the supplement; 25 subjects did not use the supplement and acted as controls. Routine blood tests were normal at inclusion and after the final triathlon. The two groups were comparable considering men and women performances at inclusion and age distribution. Drinking and training regimens were comparable between the groups. No side effects or tolerance problems were reported; all G3 drinks were used as indicated. The final measurement run was not competitive but chronometric. All subjects completed the test. All subjects performances improved with training. The improvements were seen in parallel both in men and women. The improvement was significantly greater with G3 (P<0.05). The final variation in time was superior with G3 vs. controls (P<0.05). Oxidative stress (PFR), assessed 1 h after the final run, was higher in controls (P<0.05). The higher level of PFR may be associated to a slower recovery time after training and after the test run. After the final test run triathlon, there were no significant changes in hemoglobin or serum ferritin in both groups. Athletes using G3 had a lower variation in UBR and LDH; however, both were significantly increased in controls (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: G3 supplementation significantly improved exercise performance in two weeks training time and appeared to significantly decrease oxidative stress and hemolysis resulting from exercise.",0
Can repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation prolong the antidepressant effects of sleep deprivation?,"BackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed for stabilizing the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation (SD) by preventing the relapse after a night of recovery sleep. In this study, we aimed to replicate these data coming from a small pilot study in a larger patient sample.MethodsThirty-seven patients were randomly assigned to receive either active or sham rTMS on four consecutive days after one night of SD. The majority of the participants had experienced an antidepressant effect of SD in the past. At each rTMS session 1000 stimuli were applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 10 Hz with an intensity of 110% resting motor threshold. For sham stimulation, a sham-coil system was used. Treatment effects were assessed with a modified version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and a self-report well-being scale (BfS) before SD, after SD, during rTMS and 3 days after rTMS.ResultsSD led to a highly significant reduction of depressive symptoms in the whole group as reflected by a mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scales score reduction of 56% (with omission of sleep items). In both the active and the sham-stimulated group, the symptom reduction remained stable for the whole observation period. No difference between active and sham rTMS was observed.ConclusionsSD is capable of inducing pronounced antidepressant effects. In contrast to a previous study, active rTMS was not superior to sham rTMS in stabilizing the antidepressant effects of SD, which was mainly due to a pronounced effect in the sham group in this study population.

Educator Burnout and Compassion Fatigue: A Pilot Study,"Sixty-four Canadian educators from Southwestern Ontario took part in a 2-hr voluntary workshop about the emotional labor and consequences that may be experienced by educators. A focus on both burnout and teacher compassion fatigue (CF), an underresearched area with respect to Canadian educators, was taken. The current study hypothesized that this professional development would positively influence educators' knowledge, skills, and awareness regarding burnout, CF, and self-care; furthermore, it was predicted there would be a positive correlation between burnout and CF. Results supported the efficacy of professional development and partial support was detected for the relationship between burnout and CF. Implications and future research are discussed.",0
"SLEEP, FATIGUE AND HOURS OF WORK OF FRENCH TRAIN DRIVERS","Hours of work of train drivers are known to be likely to induce fatigue that may impact safety and health. In 2007, the SNCF initiated a comprehensive research on fatigue and sleep of train drivers. The research covers the various operations: high speed, national, regional, freights and maneuver trains. The objective is to evaluate the impact of these hours of work and to figure out how fatigue could be prevented at different levels of the organization from the scheduling process to the operations. The research covers 4 steps: (1) a chronobiological evaluation of specific schedules including the use of biomathematical models, (2) the analysis from existing reporting data on health and occupational accidents as well as interviews of managers and occupational medical doctor of the drivers (3) a survey by questionnaire to investigate the impacts of hours of work on fatigue, health and social life (4) the measurement of sleep, subjective sleepiness, physiological alertness and observation data on a sample of 25 train drivers on 42 trips. Results are discussed regarding their impact on the scheduling process, in the light of the recent progress in Fatigue Risk Management Systems.",1
Mobile App Promoting Resilience in Stress Management for Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer are at risk of poor psychosocial outcomes. AYAs grew up with the internet and digital technology, and mobile Health (mHealth) psychosocial interventions have the potential to overcome care access barriers.OBJECTIVE: This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated mobile app version of the Promoting Resilience in Stress Management intervention (mPRISM). Promoting Resilience in Stress Management is an evidence-based intervention developed in collaboration with AYAs, based on stress and coping theory, resilience theory, and evidence-based coping strategies. We hypothesized that mPRISM would be feasible, acceptable, and appropriate.METHODS: This is a parallel, 2-arm, single-site pilot RCT with a waitlist control design. The study will recruit 80 AYAs with cancer from a clinic. Eligible AYAs are aged 12 to 25 years, within 12 months of a new cancer diagnosis, receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy, speak, read, or write in English, and are cognitively able to participate in study procedures. Recruitment by clinical research coordinators will occur remotely by phone, video, or text. Participants will be randomized to psychosocial usual care (UC) alone or UC plus mPRISM for an 8-week intervention period, and will remain unblinded to study condition. Enrolled participants will complete surveys at baseline before randomization, 8 weeks, and 3-month follow-up. Using a waitlist design, the UC arm will receive mPRISM upon completion of 3-month follow-up surveys. Those in the UC arm will complete 2 additional measurement points at immediate posttreatment and 3 months later. The primary outcomes of interest are feasibility, defined as ≥60% enrollment and ≥70% retention (ie, percentage of participants who completed the study), and feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness as defined by cut-off scores ≥4/5 on 3 brief validated implementation outcome measures (feasibility of implementation measure, acceptability of intervention measure [AIM], intervention appropriateness measure [IAM]). We will apply top-box scoring for the implementation measures. Exploratory outcomes of interest include patient-reported health-related quality of life, resilience, distress, anxiety, depression, pain, and sleep. We will conduct an intention-to-treat analysis to compare the outcomes of the mPRISM arm versus the control arm with covariate-adjusted regression models. We will summarize individual digital usage metrics using descriptive statistics.RESULTS: Since September 2023, we have enrolled 20 participants and recruitment is ongoing.CONCLUSIONS: Although our previous work suggests AYAs with cancer are interested in mHealth psychosocial interventions, such interventions have not yet been sufficiently evaluated or implemented among AYA oncology patients. mPRISM may serve as a potential mHealth intervention to fill this gap. In this study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of mPRISM. This work will inform future larger-scale RCTs powered for efficacy outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05842902; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05842902.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/57950.",0
The use of bluetooth low energy Beacon systems to estimate indirect personal exposure to household air pollution,"Household air pollution (HAP) generated from solid fuel combustion is a major health risk. Direct measurement of exposure to HAP is burdensome and challenging, particularly for children. In a pilot study of the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial in rural Guatemala, we evaluated an indirect exposure assessment method that employs fixed continuous PM2.5 monitors, Bluetooth signal receivers in multiple microenvironments (kitchen, sleeping area and outdoor patio), and a wearable signal emitter to track an individual's time within those microenvironments. Over a four-month period, we measured microenvironmental locations and reconstructed indirect PM2.5 exposures for women and children during two 24-h periods before and two periods after a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove and fuel intervention delivered to 20 households cooking with woodstoves. Women wore personal PM2.5 monitors to compare direct with indirect exposure measurements. Indirect exposure measurements had high correlation with direct measurements (n = 62, Spearman rho = 0.83, PM2.5 concentration range: 5-528 mu g/m(3)). Indirect exposure had better agreement with direct exposure measurements (bias: -17 mu g/m(3)) than did kitchen area measurements (bias: -89 mu g/m(3)). Our findings demonstrate that indirect exposure reconstruction is a feasible approach to estimate personal exposure when direct assessment is not possible.",0
A prospective study on peptide mapping of human fatigue saliva markers based on magnetic beads,"In order to explore convenient and stable fatigue markers, we studied various high-molecular-weight peptide fragments under fatigue state and non-fatigue state in the saliva using time of flight mass spectrometry. The saliva samples were collected from 10 healthy volunteers that were in the condition of fatigue and non-fatigue, respectively. Moreover, the time of flight mass spectrometry was conducted using two kinds of sample treatment methods, the magnetic beads enrichment (MB) and direct detection of stock solution. This was followed by modeling via the mass spectra of MB and supernatant (stock solution) directly collected after centrifugation. Both MB and direct sampling produced good spectrograms between 1,000 and 15,000 Da, while some peaks were lost in the enrichment. The spectrograms in the early and late period were different in each individual. Due to the limited sample size, 20 early and 20 late spectrograms were used for modeling analysis. Three different peptides were identified in the stock solution samples that can be detected in both fatigue and non-fatigue groups. The cross validity of MB model was 92.06%, while that of the stock solution model was 95.49%. The results showed that there were different peaks within the molecular weight of 2,000-15,000 Da, which provided a scientific basis for further realization of the convenient fatigue detection method based on the biosensor technique, with important theoretical and practical significance.",0
Effects of local authority expenditure on childhood obesity,"Background: Under the 2013 reforms introduced by the Health and Social Care Act (2012), public health responsibilities in England were transferred from the National Health Service to local authorities (LAs). Ring-fenced grants were introduced to support the new responsibilities. The aim of our study was to test whether the level of expenditure in 2013/14 affected the prevalence of childhood obesity in 2016/17. Methods: We used National Child Measurement Programme definitions of childhood obesity and datasets. We used LA revenue returns data to derive three measures of per capita expenditure: childhood obesity (<19); physical activity (<19) and the Children's 5-19 Public Health Programme. We ran separate negative binomial models for two age groups of children (4-5 year olds; 10-11 year olds) and conducted sensitivity analyses. Results: With few exceptions, the level of spend in 2013/14 was not significantly associated with the level of childhood obesity in 2016/17. We identified some positive associations between spend on physical activity and the Children's Public Health Programme at baseline (2013/14) and the level of childhood obesity in children aged 4-5 in 2016/17, but the effect was not evident in children aged 10-11. In both age groups, LA levels of childhood obesity in 2016/17 were significantly and positively associated with obesity levels in 2013/14. As these four cohorts comprise entirely different pupils, this underlines the importance of local drivers of childhood obesity. Conclusions: Higher levels of local expenditure are unlikely to be effective in reducing childhood obesity in the short term.",0
Experience and measurement of fatigue in adults with Crohn's disease: results from qualitative interviews and a longitudinal 2-week daily diary pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue has a detrimental impact on health-related quality of life and functioning in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to confirm the relevance and importance of fatigue, establish the content validity of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), qualitatively explore meaningful change in fatigue experience, and assess the measurement properties of the FACIT-F in patients with moderate-to-severe CD.METHODS: This was a mixed-methods observational study consisting of a cross-sectional qualitative interview (Part A) and a longitudinal 2-week daily diary pilot study (Part B) in participants aged≥18years with a clinical diagnosis of moderate-to-severe CD. Part A included open-ended questions related to the participant's overall experiences with CD, fatigue, and impact on daily activities and a cognitive debriefing of several patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including the FACIT-F. Part B consisted of participants completing an electronic daily diary that included the FACIT-F and other PROs for 14days. Item performance, test-retest reliability, and construct validity were assessed at baseline (Day 1), Day 7, and Day 14.RESULTS: Thirty-five participants (mean age 45.1years; 65.7% female) completed an interview (Part A). Ninety-one percent of the interview participants reported fatigue as a symptom attributed to CD. Participants indicated that fatigue had a major impact on their daily activities (e.g., recreation/ hobbies, work/school, yard work and housework), social activities, and emotional health. The FACIT-F was well understood by the interview participants. Seventy-six participants (mean age 41.9years; 66% female) completed at least the Day 1 diary entry (Part B). Potential floor and ceiling effects were observed for several FACIT-F items, but test-retest reliability and construct validity were all strong and within the ranges hypothesized a priori.CONCLUSIONS: The interviews indicate that fatigue is a frequent and bothersome symptom experienced by most patients with moderate-to-severe CD and support the content validity of the FACIT-F in this population. Daily diary study results indicate that the FACIT-F scale demonstrates adequate reliability and validity among patients with CD. These study findings suggest that the FACIT-F would be a reliable, valid, and useful measure of fatigue in patients with moderate-to-severe CD.",0
"On the Growth of Small Cracks in 2024-T3 and Boeing Space, Intelligence and Weapon Systems AM LPBF Scalmalloy®","The desire to use additively manufactured (AM) parts to ensure the availability of military aircraft, and to build limited-life unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), coupled with the United States Air Force (USAF) approach to the airworthiness certification of AM parts has focused attention on durability analysis/assessment, and hence on the growth of small cracks in AM parts. Previous studies have shown that laser powder fusion built (LPBF) Scalmalloy (R) has: i) A yield stress and an ultimate strength that are greater than that of AA2024-T3 and comparable to that of AA7075-T6; ii) A resistance to crack growth that is better than that of AA7075-T6 and comparable to that of AA2024-T3. However, since the ability to predict the durability of a part is essential for its airworthiness certification, the present paper illustrates how to perform a linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM)-based durability assessment of Boeing Space, Intelligence and Weapon System (BSIWS) LPBF Scalmalloy (R). The durability study includes specimens with both machined surfaces and surfaces left in the as-built condition. As a result, it would appear that BISWS AM LPBF Scalmalloy (R) is an ideal candidate for building limited-life AM replacement parts for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and drones.",0
Detection of obstructive sleep apnea in pediatric subjects using surface lead electrocardiogram features,"Study Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children using an automated classification system based on analysis of overnight electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings.Design: Retrospective observational study.Setting: A pediatric sleep clinic.Participants: Fifty children underwent full overnight polysomnography. Intervention: N/A.Measurements and Results: Expert polysomnography scoring was performed. The datasets were divided into a training set of 25 subjects (11 normal, 14 with OSA) and a withheld test set of 25 subjects (11 normal, 14 with OSA). Features, calculated from the ECG of the 25 training datasets, were empirically chosen to train a modified quadratic discriminant analysis classification system. The selected configuration used a segment length of 60 seconds and processed mean, SD, power spectral density, and serial correlation measures to classify segments as apneic or normal. By combining per-segment classifications and using receiver-operator characteristic analysis, a per-subject classifier was obtained that had a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 90.9%, and accuracy of 88% on the training datasets. The same decision threshold was applied to the withheld datasets and yielded a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 81.8%, and accuracy of 84%. The positive and negative predictive values were 85.7% and 81.8%, respectively, on the test dataset.Conclusions: The ability to correctly identify 12 out of 14 cases of OSA (with the 2 false negatives arising from subjects with an apnea-hypopnea index less than 10) indicates that the automated apnea classification system outlined may have clinical utility in pediatric patients.",0
"Myofascial trigger points, pain, disability and quality of sleep in patients with chronic tension-type headache: a pilot study","Introduction. The referred pain induced by myofascial trigger points (MTP) and sleep disorders can be factors that contribute to chronic tension-type headache.Aim. To determine the relationship between MTP, intensity of pain, disability and quality of sleep in people with chronic tension-type headache.Subjects and methods. Participants in the study consisted of 16 patients with chronic tension-type headache and 15 healthy controls. A visual analogue scale was used to measure the intensity of the pain, and the neck disability questionnaire and the Pittsburgh (quality of sleep) questionnaire were also employed. MTP were explored in the temporal, masseter, upper trapezius, suboccipital, sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis and anterior digastric muscles by a blind evaluator.Results. The subjects with chronic tension-type headache had greater cervical disability (p < 0.001) than the controls, whereas the quality of sleep showed a tendency (p = 0.092). A positive correlation was found between the worst pain last week with the Pittsburgh questionnaire (r = 0.631; p = 0.009) and disability (r = 0.521; p = 0.046), as well as a positive correlation between disability and quality of sleep (r = 0.815; p < 0.001). The patients with headache displayed a higher number of MTP than the healthy controls (p < 0.001), the presence of active MTP being found exclusively in the patients. No association was found between the number of MTP and intensity of pain, disability or quality of sleep.Conclusions. Quality of sleep and active MTP can be different factors contributing to chronic tension-type headache. Nevertheless, the presence of MTP could also be an epiphenomenon of the pain.",0
A FPGA based driver drowsiness detecting system,"A large number of traffic accidents are caused by the driver fatigue or drowsiness. These misfortunes can be avoided by keeping a close watch on tired characters of the driver and making a warning signal immediately. This function is implemented by a FPGA based vehicle driver surveillance system presented in this paper.Several well-known image processing algorithms like gray scale projection, edge detection with Prewitt operator and complexity function are combined together to judge whether the driver has his eyes closed. Their hardware architectures have been modeled using the Altera DSPBuilder and integrated as a co-processor to the main Nios II processor which controls the whole system. All of the algorithm hardware implementations have been achieved in a parallel and pipelined way and discussed in detail. The final system is based on the Altera Stratix II EP2S60 FPGA devices and has been proved to meet the basic requirements of drowsiness detection.",1
Cognitive behavioural therapy versus health education for sleep disturbance and fatigue after acquired brain injury: A pilot randomised trial,"Background: Sleep disturbance and fatigue are highly prevalent after acquired brain injury (ABI) and are associated with poor functional outcomes. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a promising treatment for sleep and fatigue problems after ABI, although comparison with an active control is needed to establish efficacy. Objectives: We compared CBT for sleep disturbance and fatigue (CBT-SF) with a health education (HE) intervention to control for non-specific therapy effects. Methods: In a parallel-group, pilot randomised controlled trial, 51 individuals with traumatic brain injury (n = 22) and stroke (n = 29) and clinically significant sleep and/or fatigue problems were randomised 2:1 to 8 weeks of a CBT-SF (n = 34) or HE intervention (n = 17), both adapted for cognitive impairments. Participants were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 2 and 4 months post-treatment. The primary outcome was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; secondary outcomes included measures of fatigue, sleepiness, mood, quality of life, activity levels, self-efficacy and actigraphy sleep measures. Results: The CBT-SF led to significantly greater improvements in sleep quality as compared with HE, during treatment and at 2 months [95% confidence interval (CI)-24.83;-7.71], as well as significant reductions in fatigue maintained at all time points, which were not evident with HE (95% CI-1.86; 0.23). HE led to delayed improvement in sleep quality at 4 months post-treatment and in depression (95% CI-1.37;-0.09) at 2 months post-treatment. CBT-SF led to significant gains in self-efficacy (95% CI 0.15; 0.53) and mental health (95% CI 1.82; 65.06). Conclusions: CBT-SF can be an effective treatment option for sleep disturbance and fatigue after ABI, over and above HE. HE may provide delayed benefit for sleep, possibly by improving mood.

Causal modelling in the Aviation Industry: An application for controlled flight into terrain,"In recent years, the Federal Aviation Authority and the Dutch Ministry of Transport have taken advantage of causal modelling techniques to investigate integrated safety in air traffic. Causal models are being developed with the purpose of allowing the regulator to make assessments of the effects of possible safety measures and to determine which measures will be most effective or efficient. Classical modelling techniques such as fault trees and event trees are unsuitable for this purpose because they are not able to represent 'soft' cause effect relations adequately. An example of a soft cause effect relationship is that between fatigue and mistakes. While fatigue increases the probability of mistakes, the relation is not 'hard' in the sense that not everyone who is fatigued will make an error. These soft relations play an important role in performance and behavior of human operators and managerial influences. For this purpose in (Roelen and et al. 2002) discrete Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) were introduced and demonstrated for the cases of Missed approach and Flight crew alertness. However, it was recognized that one disadvantage of the discrete BBNs was that a combinatorial explosion threatened the assessment of probabilities. To deal with this problem, simplifying assumptions leading to a very drastic discretization of variables more naturally modelled as continuous variables were taken in order to enable the quantification of the (BBN) with probabilities estimated from data. It is recognized that these simplifying assumptions reintroduce the limitations that we tried to avoid by using BBNs. In this paper the discrete model for missed approach is revised with the continuous non-parametric BBN approach.",0
Pilot study of a ketogenic diet in relapsing-remitting MS,"ObjectiveTo assess the safety and tolerability of a modified Atkins diet (KDMAD), a type of ketogenic diet (KD), in subjects with relapsing MS while exploring potential benefits of KDs in MS.MethodsTwenty subjects with relapsing MS enrolled into a 6-month, single-arm, open-label study of the KDMAD. Adherence to KDMAD was objectively monitored by daily urine ketone testing. Fatigue and depression scores and fasting adipokines were obtained at baseline and on diet. Brain MRI was obtained at baseline and 6 months. Intention to treat was used for primary data analysis, and a per-protocol approach was used for secondary analysis.ResultsNo subject experienced worsening disease on diet. Nineteen subjects (95%) adhered to KDMAD for 3 months and 15 (75%) adhered for 6 months. Anthropometric improvements were noted on KDMAD, with reductions in body mass index and total fat mass (p < 0.0001). Fatigue (p = 0.002) and depression scores (p = 0.003) were improved. Serologic leptin was significantly lower at 3 months (p < 0.0001) on diet.ConclusionsKDMAD is safe, feasible to study, and well tolerated in subjects with relapsing MS. KDMAD improves fatigue and depression while also promoting weight loss and reducing serologic proinflammatory adipokines.Classification of evidenceThe study is rated Class IV because of the absence of a non-KD control group.",0
Detecting fatigue in car drivers and aircraft pilots by using non-invasive measures: The value of differentiation of sleepiness and mental fatigue,"Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most crucial factors that contribute to a decrease of the operating performance of aircraft pilots and car drivers and, as such, plays a dangerous role in transport safety. To reduce fatigue-related tragedies and to increase the quality of a healthy life, many studies have focused on exploring effective methods and psychophysiological indicators for detecting and monitoring fatigue. However, those fatigue indicators rose many discrepancies among simulator and field studies, due to the vague conceptualism of fatigue, per se, which hinders the development of fatigue monitoring devices. Method: This paper aims to give psychological insight of the existing non-invasive measures for driver and pilot fatigue by differentiating sleepiness and mental fatigue. Such a study helps to improve research results for a wide range of researchers whose interests lie in the development of in-vehicle fatigue detection devices. First, the nature of fatigue for drivers/pilots is elucidated regarding fatigue types and fatigue responses, which reshapes our understanding of the fatigue issue in the transport industry. Secondly, the widely used objective neurophysiological methods, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electrocardiography (ECG), physical movement-based methods, vehicle-based methods, fitness-for-duty test as well as subjective methods (self-rating scales) are introduced. On the one hand, considering the difference between mental fatigue and sleepiness effects, the links between the objective and subjective indicators and fatigue are thoroughly investigated and reviewed. On the other hand, to better determine fatigue occurrence, a new combination of measures is recommended, as a single measure is not sufficient to yield a convincing benchmark of fatigue. Finally, since video-based techniques of measuring eye metrics offer a promising and practical method for monitoring operator fatigue, the relationship between fatigue and these eye metrics, that include blink-based, pupil-based, and saccade-based features, are also discussed. To realize a pragmatic fatigue detector for operators in the future, this paper concludes with a discussion on the future directions in terms of methodology of conducting operator fatigue research and fatigue analysis by using eye-related parameters.

"Self-Reporting by Unsafe Drivers Is, with Education, More Effective than Mandatory Reporting by Doctors","Study Objectives: Health professionals are frequently required to report to relevant authorities all drivers who are potentially unsafe due to medical conditions. We aimed to assess both the effect of mandatory reporting (MR) on patient self-predicted behavior and what factors might encourage unsafe drivers to self-report to these authorities.Methods: We included 5 questions in the South Australian Health Omnibus Survey, an annual, community based, face-to-face survey. We asked (1) how subjects would behave towards their doctor in light of MR if they believed their licences were at risk due to a medical condition; and (2) which factor(s) would cause them to self-report to the same authorities.Results: Responses to 3,007 surveys (response rate 68.5%, age 15-98) showed that 9.0% would avoid diagnosis, lie to their doctor, or doctor shop in order to keep their licence; 30.8% were unaware of the legislated requirement to self-report; and 37.9% were unaware of potentially jeopardizing insurance support if they failed to comply. If educated in these 2 areas, warned about the dangers of driving against medical advice and instructed to do so by their doctor, then 95.8% of people would self-report to the authorities, a number significantly higher than could be reported by their doctors (91.0%).Conclusions: MR causes 9.0% of people to predict to behave towards their doctor in a manner that reduces road safety. With education and encouragement to do so, more people will self-report to the authorities than could be reported by their doctors via the MR pathway.",0
Impact of real-world implementation of evidence-based insomnia treatment within a large payor-provider health system: initial provider and patient-level outcomes.,"Study Objectives: Insomnia has substantial and wide-ranging negative effects on clinical and functional outcomes and on health care expenditures, yet few individuals receive gold-standard insomnia treatment. The current article examines provider and patient outcomes associated with real-world implementation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), as part of a pilot initiative designed to establish initial capability for evidence-based insomnia treatment within one of the largest payor-provider systems in the United States.Methods: Provider training outcomes were assessed using the CBT-I Competency Rating Scale and self-report measures. Patient outcomes were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9.Results: All clinicians (N = 11) achieved competency in CBT-I and reported large increases in knowledge and confidence related to insomnia and insomnia treatment. Clinicians also reported high intention to deliver CBT-I and significant improvements in overall job satisfaction following competency-based CBT-I training. Among all patients who initiated CBT-I (N = 48), mixed effects modeling demonstrated significant reduction in average ISI scores (12.57 to 5.88, SEs = 1.08-1.14). More than two-thirds of patients (68.8%) completed treatment. Among completers of this brief treatment, mean insomnia severity improvement was 71% (Hedges g = 1.56).Conclusions: Findings provide support for the feasibility and effectiveness of real-world CBT-I implementation, extending past findings to a private, payor-provider context. Patient and provider-level outcomes suggest the significant opportunity private systems may have in increasing the availability of gold-standard treatment for insomnia.",0
Falling asleep at the wheel and distracted driving. The High-Risk Professional Drivers study,"Background: Sleepiness at the wheel and driving while engaged in other activities are well known risk factors for traffic accidents. This article estimates the prevalence of these factors among Italian Professional Drivers (PDs) and their impact on reported driving mistakes. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using anonymous questionnaires. PDs (n=497) were divided into two groups: high-risk PDs (HiRis_PDs) (those who self-reported more than one incident during the last 3 years and/or more than one mistake during the past year) and non-HiRis_PDs (subjects who did not meet the above-mentioned inclusion criteria). Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association of self-reported sleepiness and/or risky driving behaviour with the condition of being a high-risk driver. Results: 161 (32.4%) subjects were defined as HiRis_PDs. Forty-one percent of the interviewees experienced at least one episode per month of sudden-onset sleep at the wheel. Twenty-eight point two percent reported a regular use of a hand-held cell phone. Predictive factors for being HiRis_PDs were: at least one self-reported episode per month of falling asleep at the wheel [odds ratio (OR) 5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.21-7.80, P<0.001], driving while regularly engaged in other activities (mainly hand-held cell phone use) (OR 6.11, 95% CI 2.90-12.84, P<0.001), and young age (OR 0.96, OR 1 year of age increase, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, P=0.001). Conclusions: Focusing prevention efforts on recognizing sleepiness at the wheel and on avoiding other distracting activities while driving can reduce the possibility of driving errors on the road by about 5-6 times.",0
Stress and Workload Assessment in Aviation-A Narrative Review,"In aviation, any detail can have massive consequences. Among the potential sources of failure, human error is still the most troublesome to handle. Therefore, research concerning the management of mental workload, attention, and stress is of special interest in aviation. Recognizing conditions in which a pilot is over-challenged or cannot act lucidly could avoid serious outcomes. Furthermore, knowing in depth a pilot's neurophysiological and cognitive-behavioral responses could allow for the optimization of equipment and procedures to minimize risk and increase safety. In addition, it could translate into a general enhancement of both the physical and mental well-being of pilots, producing a healthier and more ergonomic work environment. This review brings together literature on the study of stress and workload in the specific case of pilots of both civil and military aircraft. The most common approaches for studying these phenomena in the avionic context are explored in this review, with a focus on objective methodologies (e.g., the collection and analysis of neurophysiological signals). This review aims to identify the pros, cons, and applicability of the various approaches, to enable the design of an optimal protocol for a comprehensive study of these issues.",0
"Safety and immunogenicity of the α-synuclein active immunotherapeutic PDO1A in patients with Parkinson's disease: a randomised, single-blinded, phase 1 trial","Background Robust evidence supports the role of a-synuclein pathology as a driver of neuronal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. PD01A is a specific active immunotherapy with a short peptide formulation targeted against oligomeric a-synuclein. This phase 1 study assessed the safety and tolerability of the PD01A immunotherapeutic in patients with Parkinson's disease.Methods We did a first-in-human, randomised, phase 1 study of immunisations with PD01A, followed by three consecutive study extensions. Patients aged 45-65 years with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (<= years since diagnosis and Hoehn and Yahr Stage 1 to 2), imaging results (dopamine transporter single photon emission CT and MRI) consistent with their Parkinson's disease diagnosis, and on stable doses of Parkinson's disease medications for at least 3 months were recruited at a single private clinic in Vienna, Austria. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), using a computer-generated sequence with varying block size, to receive four subcutaneous immunisations with either 15 mu g or 75 pg PD01A injected into the upper arms and followed up initially for 52 weeks, followed by a further 39 weeks' follow-up. Patients were then randomly assigned (1:1) again to receive the first booster immunisation at 15 mu g or 75 mu g and were followed up for 24 weeks. All patients received a second booster immunisation of 75 mu g and were followed up for an additional 52 weeks. Patients were masked to dose allocation. Primary (safety) analyses included all treated patients. These four studies were registered with EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT numbers 2011-002650-31, 2013-001774-20, 2014-002489-54, and 2015-004854-16.Findings 32 patients were recruited between Feb 14, 2012, and Feb 6, 2013, and 24 were deemed eligible and randomly assigned to receive four PD01A priming immunisations. One patient had a diagnosis change to multiple system atrophy and was withdrawn and two patients withdrew consent during the studies. 21 (87%) of 24 patients received all six immunisations and completed 221-259 weeks in-study (two patients in the 15 mu g dose group and one patient in the 75 mu g dose group discontinued). All patients experienced at least one adverse event, but most of them were considered unrelated to study treatment (except for transient local injection site reactions, which affected all but one patient). Serial MRI assessments also ruled out inflammatory processes. Systemic treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (n=4), headache (n=3), myalgia (n=3), muscle rigidity (n=2), and tremor (n=2). The geometric group mean titre of antibodies against the immunising peptide PD01 increased from 1:46 at baseline to 1:3580 at week 12 in the 15 pg dose group, and from 1:76 to 1:2462 at week 12 in the 75 pg dose group. Antibody titres returned to baseline over 2 years, but could be rapidly reactivated after booster immunisation from week 116 onwards, reaching geometric group mean titres up to 1:20218.Interpretation Repeated administrations of PDO1A were safe and well tolerated over an extended period. Specific active immunotherapy resulted in a substantial humoral immune response with target engagement. Phase 2 studies are needed to further assess the safety and efficacy of PDO1A for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",0
Nonspecific pain is a marker for hypovitaminosis D in patients undergoing evaluation for sleep disorders: a pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to test the hypothesis that serum vitamin D levels are abnormally low in sleep clinic patients admitting to chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain and to assess the associated risk factors. A secondary purpose was to identify a clinical biomarker for vitamin D deficiency.METHODS: We enrolled 153 consecutive patients who admitted to the presence of chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain during a comprehensive sleep evaluation at a specialist sleep medicine clinic within an academic center. Venous blood sampling was performed for determination of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL) were identified by odds ratios. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed with 10-fold cross-validation to identify a biomarker for vitamin D deficiency calculated by linear discriminant analysis.RESULTS: The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 19.8 ± 11.1, with 54% of the study population having vitamin D deficiency. This mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was lower than that observed historically in healthy controls, and was either similar or lower than in all but one representative historical cohort formed on the basis of chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency were black ethnicity, age < 60 years, and obesity. These risk factors were identified both in the entire cohort and separately in subgroups with and without obstructive sleep apnea. The biomarker (based on race, age, and body mass index) had a sensitivity and specificity for predicting vitamin D deficiency of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively.CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency was prevalent in patients with sleep disorders and chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain on evaluation in a sleep medicine clinic. Vitamin D deficiency was reliably estimated in the study population using a biomarker derived from common demographic characteristics.",0
A 12-week Baduanjin Qigong exercise improves symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis: A randomized controlled trial,"Background and purpose: Therapeutic exercises are considered effective treatments for ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Current study aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of Baduanjin qigong, a traditional Chinese exercise, for treatment of AS in a pilot RCT setting.Materials and methods: A total of 60 patients were randomly assigned, at a 1:1 ratio, to receive a 12-week Baduanjin qigong training(exercise group) or maintain their current lifestyle(no-treatment group). As primary outcomes, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index(BASDAI) and other AS symptoms were assessed at baseline and end of treatment period.Results: A total of 46 patients completed the study. At the end of treatment period, although total BASDAI scores were not statistically different, reduced scores were observed in the exercise group, compared to no-treatment group, with respect to fatigue(P = 0.03), intensity(P = 0.04) and duration(P = 0.01) of morning stiffness; exercise group also exhibited higher patient global assessment scores(P = 0.04).Conclusion: Baduanjin qigong exercise appeared to improve AS symptoms.",0
Comparison of outlier heartbeat identification and spectral transformation strategies for deriving heart rate variability indices for drivers at different stages of sleepiness,"Objective: Appropriate preprocessing for detecting and removing outlier heartbeats and spectral transformation is essential for deriving heart rate variability (HRV) indices from cardiac monitoring data with high accuracy. The objective of this study is to evaluate agreement between standard preprocessing methods for cardiac monitoring data used to detect outlier heartbeats and perform spectral transformation, in relation to estimating HRV indices for drivers at different stages of sleepiness.Methods: The study analyzed more than 3,500 5-min driving epochs from 76 drivers on a public motorway in Sweden. Electrocardiography (ECG) data were recorded in 3 studies designed to evaluate the physiological differences between awake and sleepy drivers. The Pan-Tompkins algorithm was used for peak detection of heartbeats from ECG data. Two standard methods were used for identifying outlier heartbeats: (1) percentage change (PC), where outliers were defined as interbeat interval deviating >30% from the mean of the 4 previous intervals, and (2) standard deviation (SD), where outliers were defined as interbeat interval deviating >4 SD from the mean interval duration in the current epoch. Three standard methods were used for spectral transformation, which is needed for deriving HRV indices in the frequency domain; these methods were (1) the Fourier transform; (2) an autoregressive model; and (3) the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. The preprocessing methods were compared quantitatively and by assessing agreement between estimations of 13 common HRV indices using Bland-Altman plots and paired Student's t-tests.Results: The PC method detected more than 4times as many outliers (0.28%) than SD (0.065%). Most HRV indices derived using different preprocessing methods exhibited significant systematic (P <.05) and substantial random variations.Conclusions: The standard preprocessing methods for HRV data for outlier heartbeat detection and spectral transformation show low levels of agreement. This finding implies that, prior to designing algorithms for detection of sleepy drivers based on HRV analysis, the impact of different preprocessing methods and combinations thereof on driver sleepiness assessment needs to be studied.",0
Towards remote supervision and recovery of automated railway systems: The staff's changing contribution to system resilience,"Rail automation in mainline operation raises questions about system resilience, because it goes along with increased technological and operational complexity, while ultimately discarding the train driver as front-line staff situated onboard the train. We argue in favor of keeping the layer of resilience associated with the train driver in the system through a train operator workplace that enables remote supervision, diagnosis and intervention of automated rolling stock out of a control center. Firstly, results from a simulator study featuring a prototypical remote workplace, developed in an iterative user-centered design process, show positive feedback in a sample of active German train drivers (n=20) in terms of acceptance ratings, usability assessment and perceived benefit to system resilience. Secondly, lower than optimal workload ratings in two experimental conditions of varying task load indicated free capacity for additional operational tasks throughout periods without direct manual interventions. Further insights on task load and workplace design as well as their limits are discussed, pointing out the direction for the next steps to be taken in the following design iterations. Future research needs to generate measures suitable for comparing system resilience between different grades of automation.",0
Effect of Probiotics on the Symptomatology of Autism Spectrum Disorder and/or Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents: Pilot Study,"The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of using probiotics with strains related to dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid production on clinical features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This randomized, controlled trial involved 38 children with ADHD and 42 children with ASD, aged 5-16 years, who received probiotics (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Levilactobacillus brevis 109/cfu/daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. Parent-reported symptoms were assessed using Conners' 3rd-Ed and the Social Responsiveness Scale Test, 2nd-Ed (SRS-2), and children completed the Conners Continuous Performance Test, 3rd-Ed (CPT 3) or Conners Kiddie CPT, 2nd-Ed (K-CPT 2). Executive functions, quality of life and sleep patterns were also parent-assessed. Intention-to-treat analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and nutritional covariates, revealed no significant inter-group differences in parent-reported or neuropsychological data after the probiotic intervention. However, age-stratified analyses showed improved hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms in younger children with ASD (Cohen's d = 1.245) and ADHD (Cohen's d = 0.692). Intra-group analyses supported these findings in the aforementioned age and intervention group for both diagnoses. An improvement in impulsivity for children with ASD was also observed in the intra-group analysis of the CPT commissions scores (probiotic: p = 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.216; placebo: p = 0.013, Cohen's d = -0.721). A better comfort score (quality of life) was shown in children with ASD (probiotic: p = 0.010, Cohen's d = 0.722; placebo: p = 0.099, Cohen's d = 0.456). The probiotics used, may improve hyperactivity-impulsivity in children with ASD or/and ADHD and quality of life in children with ASD. Further research is warranted to explore probiotics as an adjunctive therapeutic intervention for NDs.Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT05167110.",0
Truck driver fatigue risk assessment and management: a multinational survey,"As part of an organizational review of safety, interviews and questionnaire surveys were performed on over 700 commercial goods drivers and their managers within a series of related companies operating across 17 countries. The results examine the reported incidence of fatigue-related problems in drivers and their associations with near miss and accident experience as well as work and organizational factors. Experience of fatigue problems while driving was linked to time of day and rotation of shifts, though most associations were small. There were significant associations found between fatigue experiences and driver and management systems of break taking and route scheduling. The quantitative combined with qualitative information suggested that, where feasible, more flexible approaches to managing the scheduling and sequencing of deliveries assisted drivers in managing their own fatigue problems through appropriate break-taking. The results are interpreted within the overarching principles of risk assessment and risk control.",0
"Reach, Acceptability, and Patient Preferences of a Mobile Health-Based Survey to Assess COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Patients Receiving Dialysis.","Rationale & Objective: The majority of patients with kidney failure receiving dialysis own mobile devices, but the use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies to conduct surveys in this population is limited. We assessed the reach and acceptability of a short message service (SMS) text message-based survey that assessed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy among patients receiving dialysis.Study Design & Exposure: A cross-sectional SMS-based survey conducted in January2021.Setting & Participants: Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or home hemodialysis in a nonprofit dialysis organization in New York City.Outcomes: (1) Reach of the SMS survey, (2) Acceptability using the 4-item Acceptability of Intervention Measure, and (3) Patient preferences for modes of survey administration.Analytical Approach: We used Fisher exact tests and multivariable logistic regression to assess sociodemographic and clinical predictors of SMS survey response. Qualitative methods were used to analyze open-ended responses capturing patient preferences.Results: Among 1,008 patients, 310 responded to the SMS survey (response rate 31%). In multivariable adjusted analyses, participants who were age 80 years and above (aOR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.96) were less likely to respond to the SMS survey compared with those aged 18 to 44 years. Non-Hispanic Black (aOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.86), Hispanic (aOR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.19-0.51), and Asian or Pacific Islander (aOR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28-0.74) individuals were less likely to respond compared with non-Hispanic White participants. Participants residing in census tracts with higher Social Vulnerability Index, indicating greater neighborhood-level social vulnerability, were less likely to respond to the SMS survey (fifth vs first quintile aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37-0.99). Over 80% of a sample of survey respondents and nonrespondents completely agreed or agreed with the Acceptability of Intervention Measure. Qualitative analysis identified 4 drivers of patient preferences for survey administration: (1) convenience (subtopics: efficiency, multitasking, comfort, and synchronicity); (2) privacy; (3) interpersonal interaction; and (4) accessibility (subtopics: vision, language, and fatigue).Limitations: Generalizability, length of survey.Conclusions: An SMS text message-based survey had moderate reach among patients receiving dialysis and was highly acceptable, but response rates were lower in older (age≥80), non-White individuals and those with greater neighborhood-level social vulnerability. Future research should examine barriers and facilitators to mHealth among patients receiving dialysis to ensure equitable implementation of mHealth-based technologies.We conducted a short message service (SMS) text message-based survey that assessed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy among patients receiving dialysis in New York City. Overall response rate was 31%, and those with age≥80, non-White individuals, and participants with greater neighborhood-level social vulnerability were less likely to respond to the survey. Over 80% of participants found SMS-based surveys to be highly acceptable. Qualitative analysis showed that participants cared about the convenience, privacy, interpersonal interaction, and accessibility of surveys. Our results suggest that SMS text message surveys are a promising strategy to collect patient-reported data among patients receiving dialysis.",0
UDDSUI: An Unsafe Driving Detection System Using IoT,"People's increased use of automobiles has resulted in terrible events such as traffic accidents, deaths, and financial losses. The main elements associated with the most mishaps are driver errors and human variables influenced by medical conditions, alcohol intake, reckless or dangerous driving etc. Driver fatigue is seen as another key factor in automobile accidents. The majority of vehicular accidents are caused by the driver's actions. Data about the driver, the weather, and the vehicle may be used to determine unusual events on the road. In this paper, we offer a unique and effective method for preventing disasters caused by a driver's actions. 'Unsafe Driving Detection System Using IoT' (UDDSUI) is the name given to the proposed system. The UDDSUI system monitors the proximity of an adjacent car, alcohol intake and the exhaustion of the driver. It sends a warning message to the driver and stores the data in a cloud service via the Internet of things (IoT).",0
Sleep Hygiene Education: Efficacy on Sleep Quality in Working Women,"Background: Although sleep hygiene education represents a promising approach for patients with poor sleep quality, little research has been devoted in understanding the sleep hygiene behavior and knowledge of working women.Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a short-term sleep hygiene education program on working women with poor sleep quality.Methods: This pilot study was a prospective and an exploratory intervention study. The intervention was tested on 37 selected working women with poor sleep quality in the community. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (score 9 5) was used to identify working women with poor sleep quality. After a pretest to assess sleep quality, researchers implemented a 5-week sleep hygiene education program that addressed good sleep environments/habits, emotional stress, the influence of diet/alcohol/tobacco on sleep, exercise, and alternative therapies. Tests administered midway through the program and after program completion provided the data used to analyze effective sleep quality changes.Results: Results showed sleep hygiene education to improve participant sleep quality significantly (p < .001). The sleep quality of all participants improved over both the 3- and the 5-week education program. The six components of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (i.e., subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction) also improved.Conclusion/Implications for Practice: A brief and effective sleep hygiene education program delivered by a nurse can improve sleep quality in working women with sleeping problems.",0
"Development of SkinTracker, an integrated dermatology mobile app and web portal enabling remote clinical research studies.","Introduction: In-person dermatology clinical research studies often face recruitment and participation challenges due to travel-, time-, and cost-associated barriers. Studies incorporating virtual/asynchronous formats can potentially enhance research subject participation and satisfaction, but few mobile health tools are available to enable remote study conduct. We developed SkinTracker, a patient-facing mobile app and researcher-facing web platform, that enables longitudinal collection of skin photos, patient reported outcomes, and biometric health and environmental data.Methods: Eight design thinking sessions including dermatologists, clinical research staff, software engineers, and graphic designers were held to create the components of SkinTracker. Following iterative prototyping, SkinTracker was piloted across six adult and four pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis (AD) of varying severity levels to test and provide feedback on SkinTracker for six months.Results: The SkinTracker app enables collection of informed consent for study participation, baseline medical history, standardized skin photographs, patient-reported outcomes (e.g., Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)), medication use, adverse events, voice diary to document qualitative experiences, chat function for communication with research team, environmental and biometric data such as exercise and sleep metrics through integration with an Apple Watch. The researcher web portal allows for management and visualization of subject enrollment, skin photographs for examination and severity scoring, survey completion, and other patient modules. The pilot study requested that subjects complete surveys and photographs on a weekly to monthly basis via the SkinTracker app. Afterwards, participants rated their experience in a 7-item user experience survey covering app function, design, and desire for participation in future studies using SkinTracker. Almost all subjects agreed or strongly agreed that SkinTracker enabled more convenient participation in skin research studies compared to an in-person format.Discussion: To our knowledge, SkinTracker is one of the first integrated app- and web-based platforms allowing collection and management of data commonly obtained in clinical research studies. SkinTracker enables detailed, frequent capture of data that may better reflect the fluctuating course of conditions such as AD, and can be modularly customized for different skin conditions to improve dermatologic research participation and patient access.",0
"Mental workload assessment by monitoring brain, heart, and eye with six biomedical modalities during six cognitive tasks.","Introduction: The efficiency and safety of complex high precision human-machine systems such as in aerospace and robotic surgery are closely related to the cognitive readiness, ability to manage workload, and situational awareness of their operators. Accurate assessment of mental workload could help in preventing operator error and allow for pertinent intervention by predicting performance declines that can arise from either work overload or under stimulation. Neuroergonomic approaches based on measures of human body and brain activity collectively can provide sensitive and reliable assessment of human mental workload in complex training and work environments.Methods: In this study, we developed a new six-cognitive-domain task protocol, coupling it with six biomedical monitoring modalities to concurrently capture performance and cognitive workload correlates across a longitudinal multi-day investigation. Utilizing two distinct modalities for each aspect of cardiac activity (ECG and PPG), ocular activity (EOG and eye-tracking), and brain activity (EEG and fNIRS), 23 participants engaged in four sessions over 4 weeks, performing tasks associated with working memory, vigilance, risk assessment, shifting attention, situation awareness, and inhibitory control.Results: The results revealed varying levels of sensitivity to workload within each modality. While certain measures exhibited consistency across tasks, neuroimaging modalities, in particular, unveiled meaningful differences between task conditions and cognitive domains.Discussion: This is the first comprehensive comparison of these six brain-body measures across multiple days and cognitive domains. The findings underscore the potential of wearable brain and body sensing methods for evaluating mental workload. Such comprehensive neuroergonomic assessment can inform development of next generation neuroadaptive interfaces and training approaches for more efficient human-machine interaction and operator skill acquisition.",0
"Breath Booster! Exploring In-Car, Fast-Paced Breathing Interventions to Enhance Driver Arousal State","In this paper, we explore the delivery of fast breathing interventions in a driving context, given the proven effects of high-paced breathing on autonomic arousal. Through in-lab simulator studies, we demonstrate the feasibility of using haptic guidance to increase breathing rate, intensity, and heart rate as well as subjective perceptions of alertness and focus. We also assess usability and user receptivity towards the approach across various simulated driving scenarios (highway, city), times of day (day, night), and traffic levels (low, heavy, fast). In doing so, we outline specific use cases where fast breathing interventions are more or less appropriate and beneficial (e.g., during long, monotonous drives on the highway or at night vs. complex or tense driving scenarios), and we offer fertile future directions for the continued development of breathing systems for health and well-being.",0
A Pilot Study to Examine the Impact of Beta-Alanine Supplementation on Anaerobic Exercise Performance in Collegiate Rugby Athletes.,"Beta-alanine (BA) is a precursor to carnosine which functions as a buffer assisting in the maintenance of intracellular pH during high-intensity efforts. Rugby is a sport characterized by multiple intermittent periods of maximal or near maximal efforts with short periods of rest/active recovery. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of six weeks of beta-alanine supplementation on anaerobic performance measures in collegiate rugby players. Twenty-one male, collegiate rugby players were recruited, while fifteen completed post-testing (Mean ± SD; Age: 21.0 ± 1.8 years, Height: 179 ± 6.3 cm, Body Mass: 91.8 ± 13.3 kg, % Body Fat: 21.3 ± 4.4). Supplementation was randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner between 6.4 g/d of beta-alanine and 6.4 g/d of maltodextrin placebo. Body composition, upper and lower-body maximal strength and muscular endurance, intermittent sprint performance, and post-exercise lactate, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion were assessed before and after supplementation. Data were analyzed using a 2 * 2 (group * time) mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures on time. No significant interaction effects were noted for body mass, fat mass, fat-free mass, and percent bodyfat (p > 0.05). No performance effects resulting from beta-alanine supplementation were detected. Results from this initial pilot investigation suggest that BA exerts little to no impact on body composition parameters, muscular strength, muscular endurance, or intermittent sprinting performance. With the limited research exploring the impact of BA in this sporting context, these initial findings offer little support for BA use, but more research is needed to fully understand the potential impact of BA on various aspects of resistance exercise performance.",0
Short Sleep Duration Is Associated With Carotid Intima-Media Thickness Among Men in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study,"Background and Purpose Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a subclinical marker of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies suggest that shorter sleep duration is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but there is limited evidence regarding this association using high-quality, objective assessments of sleep. The aim of this study is to determine whether sleep duration is associated with CIMT.Methods-The study used an observational cohort consisting of 617 black and white middle-aged healthy participants (37-52 years; 58% female) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses were performed. Sleep duration was measured using wrist actigraphy monitors. CIMT was calculated using the average of 20 measurements of the mean common carotid, bulb, and internal CIMT, which was assessed using ultrasound images.Results-After adjusting for covariates, 1 hour of longer sleep duration was associated with 0.026 mm less CIMT among men (P=0.02; 95% CI,-0.047 to -0.005) and 0.001 mm less CIMT among women (P=0.91; 95% CI, -0.020 to 0.022). Segment-specific analyses indicated that the carotid bulb was a key driver of the observed association.Conclusions-Shorter objectively assessed sleep duration was associated with greater CIMT among men but not women.

Event-related Potentials in Cued Go/NoGo Task Are Possible Neuromarkers of Monotony,"Monotony or mental fatigue occurs during performing low-content and monotonous work, including the work of the operator. It is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of attention and the speed of its switching, as well as slowing in the processes of perception and motor reactions, which can lead to a loss of vigilance, self-control and the occurrence of drowsiness and, consequently, an increase in the risk of industrial injuries and accidents. In this regard, an urgent task is to develop methods for monitoring the human condition in the process of performing monotonous activities. We investigated the effect of monotony on event-related potentials (ERPs) in the visual cued Go/NoGo test. We analyzed 31-channel EEG data of 25 healthy subjects recorded before and after performing four tests with a total duration of around 1.5 hours, representing the same type of tasks with different instructions and simulating the conditions of monotonous work. After performing four tests, we observe an increase of P2 wave, decrease of the P3 Cue wave and the contingent negative variation (CNV) wave in the Cue condition, as well as the decrease of P300 wave in the NoGo condition. The results obtained in this work are assumed to reflect attenuation in proactive and reactive cognitive control during monotony and allow us to consider the P2, P3 Cue, CNV and P3 NoGo waves as possible candidates for the role of neuromarkers of monotony, which makes it promising to use these indicators in systems for monitoring the human condition during operating work.",1
Assessment of cats' behavior during a cat show,"Cats, as a highly territorial animal, may suffer from changes in their physical and social environment. The change of environment and the loss of spatial and social anchors that occur during a cat show could re-present a source of stress. Most studies concerning cat welfare have focused on shelters and catteries. To our knowledge, the literature, to date, offers no answers regarding the specific area of feline exhibitions. The aim of this pilot study is to explore behaviors and postures adopted by the cats during the exhibition day, to detect any signs of stress or discomfort. This may also clarify whether it may be necessary to make changes to the environment in which the cats are being exhibited to improve the welfare of animals. Behaviors of 82 cats were collected through direct observation (the observer stood in front of the cages once an hour, from 10 to 17, for a total of 8 times for each cat) during a feline exposition. Analysis of behaviors exhibited by cats during the exposition day revealed that most of them were sleeping (93.9%), resting (62.2%), and looking at their surroundings (92.7%). Some cats played (32.9%), and few cats hid themselves with a low frequency (20.7%). Behaviors showed by cats in our sample seem to indicate no discomfort supported also by the assumed postures, being, for the most part, body not in tension with straight ears (78.8%) and in few cases presenting belly-up. Focusing on the presence of visitors, our results indicate that most cats remain in-different to their presence, but during the high attendance of visitors at 3 and 4 pm, we recorded the largest percentage of cat hiding (P <= 0.05). In conclusion, the cat show environment represents a situation full of stressful stimuli for the cat; despite this, our results have identified few behaviors of discomfort or stress manifested only at low frequencies. This result may be due to the habituation done on cats and to the coping abilities of these animals in this context of acute stress. Further studies are required to confirm and deepen our results.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
Ergonomics Aspects and Mental Workload of Operators of Electric Power Control Centers: Case Studies in Northeast Brazil,"Electrical systems can be categorized as critical systems where failure can result in significant financial loss, injury or threats to human life. The operators of the electric power control centers perform an activity in a specialized environment and have to carry it out by mobilizing knowledge and reasoning to which they have adequate training under the terms of the existing rules. To reach this there is a common mental request of personnel involved in these centers due the need to maintain attention, memory and reasoning request. In this sense, this study aims to evaluate the Mental Workload of technical workers of the Control Centers of Electrical Energy. It was undertaken a research on operators control centers of the electricity sector in Northeast Brazil. It was used for systematic observations, followed by interview and application of the instrument National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index known as NASA-TLX. As a result there will be subsidies for an assessment of mental workload of operators, and a contribution to improving the processes of managing the operation of electric utilities and the quality of workers.",0
Smartphone based context-aware driver behavior classification using dynamic bayesian network,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) aim at reducing the risks associated with the transportation system as road accidents are becoming one of the primary causes of death in developing countries. Monitoring of driver behavior is one of the key areas of ITS and assists in vehicle safety systems. It has gained importance in order to reduce traffic accidents and ensure the safety of all the road users, from the drivers to the pedestrians. In this work, we present a context-aware system that considers the vehicle, driver and the environment for driver behavior classification as a safe or fatigue or unsafe driver (representing any other unsafe driving behavior like a drunk driver, reckless driver etc.) using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). We have designed a questionnaire to obtain the influencing factors that decide safe, unsafe and fatigue driving behavior. The collected data has been analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). It has been observed that several techniques in the past have been proposed for driver behavior classification or detection; which either use specialized sensors or hardware devices, inbuilt smartphone sensors (like a gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer and GPS etc.), complex sensor fusion algorithms and techniques to detect driver behavior. The novelty of our work lies in designing and developing a context-aware system based on Android smartphone; that considers the complete driving context (driver, vehicle and surrounding environment) and classifies the driver behavior using a DBN. In order to identify driver fatigue, results from the designed questionnaire and previous research studies have been used without the need for special hardware devices. A DBN that combines all the contextual information has been created using GeNIe Modeler. Learning of DBN has been carried out using the Expec-tation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The real-time data for DBN learning and testing has been collected on Chandigarh-Patiala National Highway, India using an Android smartphone. The proposed system yields an overall classification accuracy of 80-83%.The focus of this paper is to develop a cost-effective context-aware driver behavior classification system, to promote ITS in developing countries.",1
Reliable high speed iris detection for video based eye tracking systems,"Automatic tracking of eyes is a challenging task, with numerous applications in biometrics, security, intelligent human-computer interfaces, and driver's drowsiness detection systems. Eye localization and extraction is, therefore, the first step in approaching such problems. In this paper, a novel approach for high speed iris detection is introduced. The paper proposes to detect iris based on arc separation and circle detection. The new algorithm is more accurate and flexible in addition to its high speed. The key feature of this approach is a new circle detection algorithm. The circle detection is done by something similar to curve fitting or solving an over determined system.",0
Data-Driven Modeling for Gait Phase Recognition in a Wearable Exoskeleton Using Estimated Forces,"Accurate identification of gait phases is critical in effectively assessing the assistance provided by lower limb exoskeletons. In this study, we propose a novel gait phase recognition system called ObsNet to analyze the gait of individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI). To ensure the reliable use of exoskeletons, it is essential to maintain practicality and avoid exposing the system to unnecessary risks of fatigue, inaccuracy, or incompatibility with human-centered devices. Therefore, we propose a new approach to characterize exoskeletal-assisted gait by estimating forces on exoskeletal joints during walking. Although these estimated forces are potentially useful for detecting gait phases, their nonlinearities make it challenging for existing algorithms to generalize accurately. To address this challenge, we introduce a data-driven model that simultaneously captures both feature extraction and order dependencies, and enhance its performance through a threshold-based compensational method to filter out momentary errors. We evaluated the effectiveness of ObsNet through robotic walking experiments with two practical users with complete paraplegia. Our results indicate that ObsNet outperformed state-of-the-art methods that use joint information and other recurrent networks in identifying the gait phases of individuals with SCI (p< 0.05). We also observed reliable imitation of ground truth after compensation. Overall, our research highlights the potential of wearable technology to improve the daily lives of individuals with disabilities through accurate and stable state assessment.",0
A stereovision-based crop row detection method for tractor-automated guidance,"Steering agricultural machinery within rowed crop fields is a tedious task for producers. Automated guidance of the machinery will not only reduce operator fatigue but also increase both the productivity and safety of the operation. An essential aspect of automatic guidance is the ability to identify the pathway between the crop rows. This research was to develop an implementable row-detection algorithm for a stereovision-based agricultural machinery guidance system. The algorithm consists of functions for stereo-image processing, elevation map creation and navigation point determination. The method developed first reconstructed a three-dimensional crop elevation map from a stereovision image of crop rows and then searched for optimal navigation points from the map. The developed stereovision-based crop row detection system was tested in a soya bean field to follow both straight and curved soya bean rows at typical operating speeds. Field validation tests indicated that the stereovision-based guidance system could localise crop rows accurately and reliably in a weedy field with missing sections of soya beans. Based on crop row localisation information, an automated navigation system could guide an autonomous agricultural tractor following both straight and curved rows accurately at normal field operation speeds.

Identifying Sleep Biomarkers to Evaluate Cognition in HIV,"Sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment represent two of the most common and debilitating conditions facing seropositive (HIV+) individuals who are otherwise well controlled with antiretroviral therapy. Sleep-assessment-based biomarkers represent an important step towards improving our understanding of the unique mechanistic features that may link sleep disruption and cognition in HIV+ individuals, ultimately leading to advancements in treatment and management options. In this study, a risk score was computed via a generalized linear model (GLM), which optimally combines polysomnography (PSG) features extracted from EEG, EMG, and EOG signals, to distinguish 18 HIV+ Black male individuals with and without cognitive impairment. The optimal set of features was identified via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach, and the risk separation between the two groups, i.e., cognitively normal and cognitive impaired, was significant (and has a P-value <.001). The optimal set of predictive features were all EEG derived and sleep stage-specific. These preliminary findings suggest that sleep-based EEG features may be used as both diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cognition in HIV+ subjects.",0
Subjective awareness of sleepiness while driving in younger and older adults,"Understanding whether drivers can accurately assess sleepiness is essential for educational campaigns advising drivers to stop driving when feeling sleepy. However, few studies have examined this in real-world driving environments, particularly among older drivers who comprise a large proportion of all road users. To examine the accuracy of subjective sleepiness ratings in predicting subsequent driving impairment and physiological drowsiness, 16 younger (21-33 years) and 17 older (50-65 years) adults drove an instrumented vehicle for 2 h on closed loop under two conditions: well-rested and 29 h sleep deprivation. Sleepiness ratings (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, Likelihood of Falling Asleep scale, Sleepiness Symptoms Questionnaire) were obtained every 15min, alongside lane deviations, near crash events, and ocular indices of drowsiness. All subjective sleepiness measures increased with sleep deprivation for both age groups (p < 0.013). While most subjective sleepiness ratings significantly predicted driving impairment and drowsiness in younger adults (OR: 1.7-15.6, p < 0.02), this was only apparent for KSS, likelihood of falling asleep, and difficulty staying in the lane for the older adults (OR: 2.76-2.86, p = 0.02). This may be due to an altered perception of sleepiness in older adults, or due to lowered objective signs of impairment in the older group. Our data suggest that (i) younger and older drivers are aware of sleepiness; (ii) the best subjective scale may differ across age groups; and (iii) future research should expand on the best subjective measures to inform of crash risk in older adults to inform tailored educational road safety campaigns on signs of sleepiness.",1
The Smartphone App haMSter for Tracking Patient-Reported Outcomes in People With Multiple Sclerosis: Protocol for a Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment and monitoring decisions in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) are based commonly on clinician-reported outcomes. These reflect physical and radiological disease activity and are the most relevant endpoints in clinical trials. Over the past few years, the number of studies evaluating so-called patient-reported outcomes (PROs) has been increasing. PROs are reports from patients concerning their own health perception. They are typically obtained by means of questionnaires and aim to quantify symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and sexual dysfunction. The emergence of PROs has made a tremendous contribution to understanding the individual impact of disease in people with MS and their health-related quality of life. However, the assessment of PROs consumes resources, including time and personnel. Thus, useful ways to conveniently introduce PROs into clinical practice are needed.OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide a rationale and pilot study protocol for a mobile health (mHealth) solution named haMSter that allows for remote monitoring of PROs in people with MS.METHODS: The core function of haMSter is to provide three scientifically validated PRO questionnaires relevant to MS for patients to fill out at home once a month. Thereby, longitudinal and remote documentation of PROs is enabled. A scoring algorithm graphically plots PRO scores over time and makes them available at the next visit.RESULTS: The pilot study is currently ongoing and will evaluate adherence to this mHealth solution in 50 patients over a period of 6 months. Results from the haMSter pilot study are expected in 2021.CONCLUSIONS: haMSter is a novel mHealth-based solution for modern PRO research, which may constitute the first step in achieving the ability to integrate PROs in clinical practice. This allows for a more problem-oriented approach in monitoring visits, which addresses patient needs and ultimately saves time.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04555863; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04555863.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/25011.",0
Eye tracking communication with intubated critically ill patients: a proof-of-concept multicenter pilot study,"BACKGROUND: Communication is essential to establish patient-caregivers relationship in the intensive care unit. In-tubated patients are not able to speak because the tracheal tube prevents vocalization. Use of communication tools such as eye tracking device could improve communication with intubated patients. The objective of this feasibility pilot study was to demonstrate that an eye tracking device specifically developed for the intensive care could be used easily by awake intubated patient with a very short training time.METHODS: This prospective multicenter study was conducted in four intensive care units. We included awake adult intubated patients. The device used included an eye-tracking infrared detection and a communication interface specifi-cally developed.RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were included: the median age of patients was 66 years (56-72) and 97 (64%) were male, 97 patients (64%) succeed totally (installation; calibration, succeed to select all three icons), 124 (82%) succeed to select at least one icon, and 111 (74%) succeed to point to at least two icons. The main reasons for failure to use the device were: difficulties to open or to keep the eyes open, difficulties to installing the device occurred, and patient fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the use of an eye tracking technology device specifically designed for the in-tensive care setting, with a short training is easy to use for intubated patient. Patients, relatives and caregivers showed high satisfaction.(Cite this article as: Bodet-Contentin L, Szymkowicz E, Delpierre E, Chartier D, Gadrez P, Muller G, et al.

Backlash Identification in Two-Mass Systems by Delayed Relay Feedback,"Backlash, also known as mechanical play, is a piecewise differentiable nonlinearity which exists in several actuated systems, comprising, e.g., rack-and-pinion drives, shaft couplings, toothed gears, and other machine elements. Generally, the backlash is nested between the moving parts of a complex dynamic system, which handicaps its proper detection and identification. A classical example is the two-mass system which can approximate numerous mechanisms connected by a shaft (or link) with relatively high stiffness and backlash in series. Information about the presence and extent of the backlash is seldom exactly known and is rather conditional upon factors such as wear, fatigue, and incipient failures in the components. This paper proposes a novel backlash identification method using one-side sensing of a two-mass system. The method is based on the delayed relay operator in feedback that allows stable and controllable limit cycles to be induced and operated within the (unknown) backlash gap. The system model, with structural transformations required for the one-side backlash measurements, is given, along with the analysis of the delayed relay in velocity feedback. Experimental evaluations are shown for a two-inertia motor bench that has coupling with backlash gap of about 1 deg.",0
Energy-Efficient Coordinated Sleep of LTE Cells,"Estimates indicate that about 80% of the power consumption of cellular networks must be supplied by operators. It is thus becoming of paramount importance to improve the energy efficiency of cellular networks at the operator side for an economic and environmentally-sustainable traffic growth.The introduction of discontinuous transmission - or sleep mode - at the base stations can enable a reduction of power consumption. To further enhance the reduction, this paper proposes to coordinate the sleep scheduling among neighboring cells. The sleep schedule coordination allows the inter-cell interference reduction, during the sleep periods.This paper assesses the performance of different sleep schedules (uncoordinated, coordinated orthogonal and coordinated partially-orthogonal) applied to cellular networks based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) protocol. Simulation results show that only by coordinating the sleep schedules it is possible to significantly improve the throughput and the energy efficiency. In particular, the coordinated orthogonal sleep schedule is able to reduce the energy consumption by over 80%, achieving a gain of about 13%.",0
"The effects of acute treatment with paroxetine, amitriptyline, and placebo on driving performance and cognitive function in healthy Japanese subjects: A double-blind crossover trial","Objective To assess the effects of antidepressants on driving performance from a different methodological viewpoint in light of the recent traffic accidents.Methods In this double-blinded, 3-way crossover trial, 17 healthy males received acute doses of 10 mg paroxetine, 25 mg amtriptyline, and placebo. The subjects were administered three driving tasks-road tracking, car following, and harsh braking - performed using a driving simulator and three cognitive tasks-Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Continuous Performance Test, and N-back test at baseline and at 1 h and 4 h post-dosing. The Stanford Sleepiness Scale scores were also assessed.Results At 4 h post-dosing, amitriptyline significantly impaired road-tracking and car-following performance, reduced driver vigilance, and caused subjective somnolence. Paroxetine impaired neither driving performance nor cognitive function.Conclusions Acute doses of amitriptyline significantly impaired driving performance in the context of driving on crowded urban roads at relatively low speeds. This setting is important with respect to skills necessary for daily driving and may be difficult to measure in actual driving tests. This simulator-based study replicated the results of previous studies and could be considered complementary to them. This method may enable easy and safe screening of the driving hazard potential of drugs. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0
Longitudinal surveys on effects of changes in road traffic noise:: effects on sleep assessed by general questionnaires and 3-day sleep logs,"Adverse health effects including sleep disturbances by road traffic noise were studied among inhabitants in a residential area near Vastra Brackevagen in Goteborg city, Sweden, in 1986 and 1987, before and after the introduction of night traffic regulations. The results of those studies showed a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and poorer sleep quality in the exposed areas as compared with the control area. This paper presents results on sleep based on new studies done with general questionnaires and daily sleep logs for a period of 3 nights in 1997 and 1999 in the same areas, before and after the opening of a new tunnel for road traffic. At this time, road traffic had been substantially reduced from about 25 000 to 2 400 vehicles per 24 h and from 1375 to 180 vehicles per night (22-06). It is concluded from these long-term investigations that exposure to high levels of road traffic noise induces adverse effects on sleep and that sleep quality is significantly improved after an extensive noise reduction. Sleep quality assessed by a single general questionnaire may give equally good precision as daily reports on sleep over several days. Furthermore, a higher response rate is achieved by a single questionnaire. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
A pilot randomised controlled trial of a telehealth-delivered brief 'Sleeping Sound Autism' intervention for autistic children,"Background: Access to behavioural sleep intervention is beneficial for autistic children, yet many families face barriers to access associated with location and time. Preliminary evidence supports telehealth-delivered sleep intervention. However, no studies have evaluated brief telehealth sleep intervention. To address this, we evaluated telehealth delivery of the brief behavioural Sleeping Sound Autism intervention, using a two-armed, parallel-group, non-blinded, pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) design (trial registration: ANZCTR12620001276943). Method: Sixty-one families of autistic children without intellectual disability (5-12 years, 46% female) with caregiver-reported moderate-severe behavioural sleep problems participated Australia-wide, randomised to an intervention (n = 30) or treatment as usual control group (n = 31). Intervention group participants were invited to attend two video-conference telehealth sessions and one follow-up phone call with a trained clinician. Survey data was collected from caregivers at baseline and three- and six-months post-randomisation, to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy. Ten intervention group caregivers participated in end-of-study semi- structured interviews to explore their experiences. Results: Forty-nine caregivers completed surveys. At baseline, 87% felt positive and 84% felt confident about participating via telehealth, and 75% believed the program would improve child sleep. At three-months, intervention group caregivers (n = 24) reported the usefulness (100%) of and preference for (71%) telehealth, and 95.8% would recommend this sleep program to other families. A significant group by time difference was observed in child sleep (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire) with large effect sizes (d = 0.87-1.05), emotion and behaviour (Developmental Behavior Checklist 2) with moderate effect sizes (d = 0.40-0.57), and caregiver mental health (Kessler 10) with small to moderate effect sizes (d = 0.60-0.28), favouring the intervention group (n = 23). There were no significant group differences in child (Child Health Utility instrument) or caregiver (Assessment of Quality of Life) quality of life. However, there were individual differences in the clinical significance of improved child sleep. Qualitative data showed that whilst telehealth was convenient for caregivers, without attenuating the benefits of most key intervention features, not all children were able to engage effectively with the clinician via telehealth. Conclusions: This first pilot RCT of a brief telehealth behavioural sleep intervention for primary-school-aged autistic children suggests that telehealth delivery is acceptable, feasible and likely efficacious in improving sleep in the short-term. Providing families with ongoing choice of mode of delivery (telehealth/in-person) and examining the person-environment fit of telehealth for autistic children is important.",0
17-4 PH Steel Parts Obtained through MEX and PBF-LB/M Technologies: Comparison of the Structural Properties,"The material extrusion (MEX) method utilizing highly filled metal filament presents an alternative to advanced additive metal manufacturing technologies. This process enables the production of metal objects through deposition and sintering, which is particularly attractive compared to powder bed fusion (PBF) technologies employing lasers or high-power electron beams. PBF requires costly maintenance, skilled operators, and controlled process conditions, whereas MEX does not impose such requirements. This study compares research on 17-4 PH steel manufactured using two different commercially available techniques: MEX and powder bed fusion with laser beam melting (PBF-LB/M). This research included assessing the density of printed samples, analyzing surface roughness in two printing planes, examining microstructure including porosity and density determination, and measuring hardness. The conducted research aimed to determine the durability and quality of the obtained samples and to evaluate their strength. The research results indicated that samples produced using the PBF-LB/M technology exhibited better density and a more homogeneous structure. However, MEX samples exhibited better strength properties (hardness).",0
Single-center experience of the FIRM technique to ablate paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation,"Introduction Focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM)-guided ablation has had mixed results of published success, and most studies have had a follow-up for a year or less. We aimed to study a consecutive group of patients followed for at least 1.5 years, subgrouped into those with an initial FIRM ablation and those with a previous, failed ablation who now received a FIRM guided one, to evaluate for success in each group and factors that might affect success. Methods Of 181 patients, 167 were available for analysis. Group 1 (n = 122) had a first or primary ablation (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [PAF] 51; persistent atrial fibrillation [PeAF] 71) and group 2 (n = 45) had a redo ablation (PAF 18; PeAF 27). All patients were done under general anesthesia. FIRM mapping was done in the right atrium first and then the left, and only rotors consistently seen on multiple epochs were ablated, using 15 to 30 W. Rotor ablation was discontinued when remapping showed elimination of rotational activity at the site. Wide area catheter ablation was done for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Routine follow-up was at 3, 6, and 12 months of the first year, with a Holter monitor at 6 months, and then every 6 months thereafter. Event recorders were given to patients with potential arrhythmic symptoms. Results Mean follow-up was 16 months. Nearly 40% of patients had obstructive sleep apnea; mean body mass index was 32; and average left atrial size was 39.7 mm and 46.2 mm for PAF and PeAF patients, respectively. Freedom from atrial arrhythmia recurrence was: in group 1 patients, 82.4% for PAF and 67.6% for PeAF patients; in group 2 patients, 83.3% for PAF, but only 40.7% for PeAF patients. Comparing outcomes for the first 10 patients studied to the next 20 or more done by three operators showed no difference, suggesting no learning curve affecting the ablation results. Furthermore, the univariate analysis did not show any demographic factor to have an independent significance for ablation success or failure. Spontaneous termination during rotor ablation occurred in 76.8% of PAF and 27.6% of PeAF patients but did not affect the long-term outcomes for maintenance of sinus rhythm. Conclusions FIRM-guided atrial ablation plus PVI in our patient population resulted in good success from a recurrence of atrial arrhythmias in patients undergoing an initial ablation procedure. For those with persistent AF undergoing a second procedure now using FIRM guidance plus PVI, the results are lower. Further research is needed to define better the appropriate population for FIRM-guided ablation and the degree of ablation needed for success in these patients.",0
A Pilot Study of the Feasibility and Outcomes of Yoga for Lung Cancer Survivors,"Purpose/Objectives: To determine the feasibility of a standardized yoga intervention for survivors of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, effects on sleep, mood, salivary cortisol levels, and quality of life (QOL).Design: This 14-week, one-group, repeated-measures study included a three-week preintervention phase, eight weeks of yoga classes (40 minutes once per week) and home practice, and a three-week postintervention phase. Follow-up occurred at three and six months poststudy.Setting: A community-based cancer support center in the midwestern United States.Sample: 7 adults who had completed initial treatment for stages I IIIa NSCLC.Methods: A standardized yoga protocol was developed prior to the study by experts in the field. Breathing ease was monitored before, during, and after classes to assess feasibility of movement without compromising respiratory status white doing yoga. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, repeated-measures analysis of variance, and salivary cortisol analysis.Main Research Variables: Sleep quality, mood, salivary cortisol, and QOL were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Profile of Mood States Brief, a cortisol measurement, and the Medical Outcomes Survey SF36 (R), respectively. Breathing ease was assessed using a dyspnea numeric rating scale as well as observation of participants.Findings: Participants with varying stages of disease and length of survivorship were able to perform yoga without respiratory distress. Class attendance exceeded 95%, and all practiced at home. Mood, sleep efficiency, and QOL significantly improved; salivary cortisol levels decreased over time.Conclusions: Yoga was feasible for NSCLC survivors without further compromising breathing with movement. Potential benefits were identified, supporting the need for future clinical trials with larger samples stratified by cancer stage, treatment, and length of survivorship.Implications for Nursing: Nurses and healthcare providers should consider yoga as a mind-body practice to manage stress, improve mood and sleep, and potentially enhance QOL for NSCLC survivors.",0
Accuracy of ECG-based screening for sleep-disordered breathing: a survey of all male workers in a transport company,"Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and for sleepiness-related accidents, but > 75 % of the patients remain undiagnosed. We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ECG-based detection of SDB when used for population-based screening.All male workers, mostly truck drivers, of a transport company (n = 165; age, 43 +/- 12 years) underwent standard attended overnight polysomnography. Cyclic variation of heart rate (CVHR), a characteristic pattern of heart rate associated with SDB, was detected from single-lead ECG signals during the polysomnography by a newly developed automated algorithm of autocorrelated wave detection with adaptive threshold (ACAT).Among 165 subjects, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was a parts per thousand yen5 in 62 (38 %), a parts per thousand yen15 in 26 (16 %), and a parts per thousand yen30 in 16 (10 %). The number of CVHR per hour (CVHR index) closely correlated with AHI [r = 0.868 (95 % CI, 0.825-0.901)]. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for detecting subjects with AHI a parts per thousand yen5, a parts per thousand yen15, and a parts per thousand yen30 were 0.796 (95 % CI, 0.727-0.855), 0.974 (0.937-0.993), and 0.997 (0.971-0.999), respectively. With a predetermined criterion of CVHR index a parts per thousand yen15, subjects with AHI a parts per thousand yen15 were identified with 88 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity (likelihood ratios for positive and negative test, 30.7 and 0.12). The classification performance was retained in subgroups of subjects with obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and decreased autonomic function.The CVHR obtained by the ACAT algorithm may provide a useful marker for screening for moderate-to-severe SDB among apparently healthy male workers.",1
Sleep quality and nighttime sleep duration mediated the association between occupational stress and work-related musculoskeletal disorders among bus drivers,"BackgroundWork-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) significantly affect bus drivers' health and warrant adequate attention. Previous studies had reported associations between occupational stress exposure and WMSDs, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the associations of occupational stress with WMSDs and the mediated effect of sleep quality and nighttime sleep duration.MethodsA total of 1,792 bus drivers with the available information from 5 subsidiaries of Shenzhen Bus Group were included by the convenience sampling method. Logistic regression model was used to estimate the associations of occupational stress, sleep quality and nighttime sleep duration with WMSDs. Mediation analysis was performed to explore the role of sleep quality and nighttime sleep duration in the association between occupational stress and WMSDs.ResultsThe prevalence rate of single-site, multiple-site, and overall WMSDs among bus drivers were 10.04%, 59.26%, and 69.31%, respectively. We found that occupational stress was significantly associated with an increased risk of both multiple-site WMSDs and overall WMSDs [OR (95% CI) = 1.92 (1.56, 2.36) and 2.03 (1.63, 2.55), respectively]. Compared to those with high sleep quality, bus drivers with poor sleep quality exhibited a higher risk of multiple-site WMSDs and overall WMSDs [OR (95% CI) = 3.73 (2.89, 4.84) and 4.82 (3.53, 6.71), respectively]. Each 1-hour increment in nighttime sleep duration was linked to a 36% declined risk of multiple-site WMSDs and a 37% reduced risk of overall WMSDs [OR (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.58, 0.71) and 0.63 (0.57, 0.70), respectively]. Moreover, mediation analysis showed that sleep quality mediated 48.94% and 48.70%, and nighttime sleep duration mediated 19.63% and 18.64%, of the associations between occupational stress and multiple-site WMSDs and overall WMSDs, respectively.ConclusionOccupational stress and poor sleep quality significantly elevated the risk of both multiple-site and overall WMSDs, while increased nighttime sleep duration was associated with a reduced risk of multiple-site and overall WMSDs. Sleep quality and nighttime sleep duration emerged as potential mediators in multiple-site and overall WMSDs induced by occupational stress. Highlighting the importance of reducing occupational stress, maintaining good sleep quality and sufficient nighttime sleep duration for WMSDs prevention.",0
Thermal and mechanical reliability tests of lead - free soldered SMT joints,"One of the main goals in development of electronics manufacturing technology, after implementation of EU Directive RoHS, is the reliability improvement of electronic interconnection systems. Investigations of lead - free technology for small producers of electronic equipment (SAIM) were made in Warsaw University of Technology (WUT) in frame of GreenRoSE Project financed by EC. Achieved results of accelerated thermal and mechanical cycling fatigue tests of SnPb37 and lead-free SAIT solder joints are presented. Two PC test boards finishes: immersion tin and leadfree HASL were applied. The samples were assembled and soldered on GreenRoSE pilot line. Thermal cycling(air to air) tests were performed in two zone thermal shock chamber For mechanical tests was used new laboratory stand designed by WUT [1]. The failures occurred during the tests were detected by four point resistance measurements and visual inspection. The results showed that achieved reliability data of lead - free soldered joints are satisfactory, however, for high reliability applications, further investigations are necessary.",0
Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Using a Smartphone Application in China A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial,"IMPORTANCE Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (DCBT-I) requires adaptation to different sociocultural contexts. Moreover, studies comparing DCBT-I and sleep education in the same operating interface are lacking.OBJECTIVE To investigate the efficacy of a smartphone-based Chinese culture-adapted DCBT-I application (app) for insomnia compared with sleep education using the same app.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted from March 2021 to January 2022. Screening and randomization were conducted at Peking University First Hospital. Follow-up visits were performed online or in the same hospital. After assessing for eligibility, eligible participants were enrolled and allocated (1:1) to DCBT-I or sleep education groups. Data were analyzed from January to February 2022.INTERVENTIONS A Chinese smartphone-based app with the same interface was used in both DCBT-I and sleep education groups over 6 weeks, with 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores with the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included sleep diary measures; self-reported scales assessing dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, mental health, and quality of life; and smart bracelet measures.RESULTS Of 82 participants (mean [SD] age, 49.67 [14.49] years; 61 [74.4%] females), with 41 randomized to sleep education and 41 randomized to DCBT-I; 77 participants completed the 6-week intervention (39 participants in the sleep education group and 38 participants in the DCBT-I group; full analysis data set) and 73 completed the 6-month follow-up (per protocol data set). Mean (SD) ISI scores in the DCBT-I group were significantly lower than those in the sleep education group after the 6-week intervention (12.7 [4.8] points vs 14.9 [5.0] points; Cohen d=0.458; P=.048) and at the 3-month follow-up (12.1 [5.4] points vs 14.8 [5.5] points; Cohen d=0.489; P=.04). There were significant improvements from before to after the intervention for both the sleep education and DCBT-I groups, with large effect sizes(sleep education: d=1.13; DCBT-I: d=1.71). Some of the sleep diary measures and self-reported scales showed more improvements in the DCBT-I group than sleep education group, such as total sleep time (mean [SD]: 3 months, 403.9 [57.6] minutes vs 363.2 [72.3] minutes; 6 months, 420.3 [58.0] minutes vs 389.7 [59.4] minutes) and sleep efficiency (mean [SD]: 3 months, 87.4% [8.3%] vs 76.7% [12.1%]; 6 months, 87.5% [8.2%] vs 78.1% [10.9%]).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial, the smartphone-based Chinese culture-adapted DCBT-I improved insomnia severity compared with sleep education. Future multicenter clinical trials with large sample sizes are needed to validate its effectiveness in the Chinese population.",0
DRIVER DISTRACTION DETECTION AND RECOGNITION,"Statistics have shown that the main reason for traffic accidents is human error. Modern vehicles are equipped to protect occupants in the event of a crash. The latest advanced vehicles come with driver behavior monitoring systems in recent years, and many have been proven to be effective systems in the prevention of accidents. However, these systems do not provide a complete solution and can only detect driver fatigue or driver distraction.This project aims to build an AI model for sensing the distraction of drivers and identifying the kind of distraction using the Kinect sensor and the Brio camera and reorient driver's attention on driving. For this, the system is divided into three sub-segments; calling arm position (arms up or down, arms right or left), facial expressions (blinking and mouth), and head orientation. Each segment develops important info for gauging the distraction of a driver based on the depth mapping of data and color from the Kinect sensor and Brio camera respectively. Testing on a driving simulator is completed on 4 different drivers of diverse ethnicity, sex, and age along with over 240 mins of recorded material. Since all the segments were recorded and prepared separately, they can further be taken to build different outcomes and can be implemented for real car systems.",1
A methodology for the real-time measurement of distal extremity temperature,"The real-time measurement of distal extremity temperature may have a wide variety of uses, from assessing occupational cold exposure to determining the impact of autonomic dysfunction on normal thermoregulation. In this study, we describe a novel approach to the measurement of this physiologic parameter by the use of datalogger iButtons (R) affixed to the foot and outer clothing, the latter serving as an approximate measure of ambient temperature, in conjunction with the measurement of foot movement via actigraphy. This approach was piloted in 20 individuals, all of whom were also requested to maintain a diary of activities during the measurement period. The technique was found to be reliable and well tolerated amongst the group of subjects, with no individual suffering an adverse reaction (e.g. skin breakdown) while wearing the device. However, periods of ambient temperature data were suspect in at least 25% of the recordings, presumably due to misplacement of the sensor. Several approaches to data analysis suggested themselves, including separate analysis of the nocturnal/sleep and awake data sets. The use of datalogger iButtons (R) in conjunction with actigraphy appears to be a potential useful approach for the acquisition of real- time distal extremity temperature and movement data and has the potential of serving a variety of clinical and research purposes.",0
Self-help therapy for sleep problems in hospital nurses in Japan: a controlled pilot study,"The present pilot study examined the effectiveness of self-help therapy (SHT) in hospital nurses in Japan. Twenty-five hospital nurses (22 female, mean age 39.7 +/- 14.6 years) participated in a 90-min workshop covering sleep hygiene education and brief stress management. After the workshop, participants in the SHT group (n = 10) were asked to practice good sleep habits, relaxation techniques, and keep a sleep diary, whereas participants in the control group (n = 15) were not. Pre- and post-test questionnaires, including the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (J-PSQI), were administered at a 2-week interval to assess subjective sleep quality, sleepiness, depressive symptoms, burnout, and quality of life. Changes in outcomes by treatment conditions were compared using linear mixed models. We found significant improvement in subjective sleep quality (global PSQI scores) in the SHT group, with Cohen's d of 0.40. Participants with sleep problems at pre- test in the SHT group (scoring above the PSQI-J cut-off point) showed significant reduction in sleep latency and sleep disturbance, while those in the control group did not (Cohen's d of 0.48 and 0.15, respectively). No significant improvement was found in the SHT group for sleepiness, although a clinically significant change was observed for subjective sleep quality and sleepiness in this group. No significant improvement was observed in either group for depressive symptoms, burnout, and quality of life. Our results provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of SHT for sleep problems in hospital nurses in Japan.",0
The Impact of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia on Sleep Log and Actigraphy Outcomes in People with Multiple Sclerosis: A Secondary Analysis,"Purpose: While studies indicate cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improves self-report sleep outcomes from questionnaires in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), it is unclear if CBT-I improves outcomes from a sleep log or sleep assessed objectively via actigraphy in people with MS. This study aimed to determine if CBT-I improves sleep log and actigraphy outcomes in individuals with MS.Patients and Methods: Twenty-five participants (Mage= 53.04, SD= 10.90) were included in this secondary analysis of data from a pilot randomized control study to assess the feasibility and treatment effect of CBT-I in individuals with MS. Participants were asked to maintain a sleep log and wear an actigraph for a week at baseline and post-intervention. Participants were randomized into one of three groups (CBT-I, active control, or one-time brief education control group). One-way ANOVAs were used to assess for group differences and within group change in sleep latency, sleep efficiency (SE), time in bed, total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset, variability of SE, and variability of TST.Results: CBT-I resulted in an increase in sleep efficiency (SE) and decrease in time in bed (TIB) and variability of SE from the sleep log. The CBT-I group also experienced a decrease in TIB and total sleep time (TST) from actigraphy. The active control group demonstrated an increase in variability of SE from actigraphy.Conclusion: This study indicates that individuals with MS may experience an improvement in sleep log and actigraphy sleep outcomes following CBT-I, but findings need to be replicated in a larger prospective study. The decrease in TST from actigraphy mirrors results from prior studies.",0
Phase Response Curve to Light under Ambulatory Conditions: A Pilot Study for Potential Application to Daylight Saving Time Transitions,"Several studies have investigated the relationship between daylight saving time (DST) and sleep alterations, psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular events and traffic accidents. However, very few have monitored participants while maintaining their usual lifestyle before and after DST. Considering that DST transitions modify human behavior and, therefore, people's light exposure patterns, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of DST on circadian variables, considering sleep and, for the first time, the human phase response curve to light. To accomplish this, eight healthy adults (33 +/- 11 years old, mean +/- SD) were recruited to monitor multivariable circadian markers and light exposure by means of a wearable ambulatory monitoring device: Kronowise (R). The following night phase markers were calculated: midpoints of the five consecutive hours of maximum wrist temperature (TM5) and the five consecutive hours of minimum time in movement (TL5), sleep onset and offset, as well as sleep duration and light intensity. TM5 for wrist temperature was set as circadian time 0 h, and the balance between advances and delays considering the phase response curve to light was calculated individually before and after both DST transitions. To assess internal desynchronization, the possible shift in TM5 for wrist temperature and TL5 for time in movement were compared. Our results indicate that the transition to DST seems to force the circadian system to produce a phase advance to adapt to the new time. However, the synchronizing signals provided by natural and personal light exposure are not in line with such an advance, which results in internal desynchronization and the need for longer synchronization times. On the contrary, the transition back to ST, which implies a phase delay, is characterized by a faster adaptation and maintenance of internal synchronization, despite the fact that exposure to natural light would favor a phase advance. Considering the pilot nature of this study, further research is needed with higher sample sizes.",0
Hazard perception in novice and experienced drivers: The effects of sleepiness,"One driver skill that has been found to correlate with crash risk is hazard perception ability. The purpose of this study was to investigate how hazard perception latencies change between high and low sleepiness for a high risk group (novice drivers) and a lower risk group (experienced drivers). Thirty-two novice drivers (aged 17-24 years) and 30 experienced drivers (aged 28-36) completed a validated video-based hazard perception test, in which participants were asked to anticipate genuine traffic conflicts in footage filmed from the driver's perspective, with separate groups tested at either 10 a.m. (lower sleepiness) or at 3 a.m. (higher sleepiness). We found a significant interaction between sleepiness and experience, indicating that the hazard perception skills of the more experienced drivers were relatively unaffected by mild increases in sleepiness while the inexperienced drivers were significantly slowed. The findings suggest that the disproportionate sleepiness-related accident involvement of young, inexperienced drivers could be partly due to a slowing of their ability to anticipate traffic hazards.

Efficacy and safety evaluation of once-daily OROS hydromorphone in patients with chronic low back pain: a pilot open-label study (DO-127),"Objective: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of once-daily osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system (OROS) hydromorphone in patients with chronic low back pain of mode rate-to-severe intensity.Research design and methods: This was a 6-week, multicenter, nonrandomized, noncomparative, open-label, repeat-dose study of chronic (>= 6 weeks) low back pain. The study comprised three periods: prior opioid stabilization (2-7 days); OROS hydromorphone conversion, titration, and stabilization (3-14 days); and OROS hydromorphone maintenance (28 days). Patients were evaluated weekly. Baseline pain assessment was performed at the end of prior opioid stabilization. For pain relief rating, endpoint was defined as the mean pain relief score from the last 2 nonmissing days before study termination. For other assessments, endpoint was defined as the last post-baseline evaluation.Results: Of the 207 patients who received the study drug, 131 completed the trial. Scores (mean SD) for Brief Pain Inventory 'worst pain in the last 24 hours' decreased significantly from baseline to endpoint (-0.8 +/- 2.06, p < 0.0001). The proportions of patients and investigators rating the global effectiveness as good, very good, or excellent increased from 31.6% at baseline while patients were on prior opioids to 63.2% at endpoint while patients received OROS hydromorphone, and from 29.8% at baseline while patients were on prior opioids to 65.8% at endpoint while patients received OROS hydromorphone, respectively. Daily pain relief ratings also increased significantly (+0.26 +/- 1.084, p = 0.0008). Significant improvements in health-related quality of life and sleep problems were observed. Adverse events were mild to moderate in severity; the most common of these were constipation, nausea, headache, and somnolence. The limitations of this study include its pilot-type design and the lack of comparison of OROS hydromorphone with a placebo or another drug. Additional comparative and longer-term studies are needed to confirm these findings.Conclusions: OROS hydromorphone may be an effective treatment for chronic low back pain of moderate-to-severe intensity. Adverse events were typical of those associated with opioid therapy.",0
Measuring glare induced visual fatigue by fixation disparity variation,"OBJECTIVE: To introduce fixation disparity variance as an objective measure of visual discomfort. A higher variance in fixation disparity is indicative of more visual fatigue. This observation is based on the results from a study where we investigated how fixation disparity was affected by glare on a VDU. Participants. In total 16 subjects with normal vision participated in this study.METHOD: In a balanced repeated-measurement experiment, all subjects performed equal near-vision tasks. In addition to the condition of no glare three controlled conditions of glare were used: direct light, indirect light, and desk luminary. After each condition, the fixation disparity was measured 15 times using a computerized fixation disparity test.RESULTS: The results showed that the average (mean) disparity was found to increase towards esophoric (crossed) with the adversity of the lighting conditions, but the differences were not significant. However, when analyzing the variation (standard deviation) within the 15 measurements and comparing these between conditions, we found that the direct light condition resulted in significantly higher variation compared to lighting condition of no glare and desk luminary lighting.CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we argue that fixation disparity variance may be a useful objective measure of visual fatigue.",0
Low-Power Hardware-Friendly Fatigued Driving Detection Based on Feature Fusion and Time Series Classification,"The grim reality of fatigued driving-caused traffic accidents indicates the urgent need to establish a robust fatigued driving detection method to prevent drivers from falling asleep while driving. Previous studies on this topic have little consideration on the sequence-level characteristics of driver's behaviors, furthermore, many of them only focus on one type of feature, which limits the accuracy and flexibility. Besides, most existing computer vision-based studies perform experiments on high-performance hardware like GPUs, which can not demonstrate their performance in the reality, as it is impractical to equip such high-end computing hardware in vehicles. This paper proposes a novel low-power hardware-friendly fatigued driving detection method based on multi-feature fusion and time series classification. The system utilizes a camera installed on the vehicle for driver monitoring. Continuous frames of a specific duration are a detection sequence. Multiple physical features including head orientation, face landmark coordinates, EFV (Eye Feature Vector), and MFV (Mouth Feature Vector) are extracted from each frame. A neural network optimized for low-power hardware is used to classify the multivariate time series samples denoting the driver's state into two classes: fatigued or alert. Sequence-level analysis reduces the false positive rate by avoiding being affected by accidental symptoms. Multi-feature enhances the capability to give the right detection results in complex and changeable driving scenarios. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on an ARM platform-based device simulating the low-power in-vehicle hardware environment. Experiments show our models surpass existing studies by up to 11.49% on accuracy and achieve up to 1.41x speedup, proving the significant advantages of the proposed method.",1
Multimodal Detection of Drivers Drowsiness and Distraction,"Considering the ever-growing presence of automobiles around the world, ensuring the safety of those on and near roadways is of great importance. From the causes of accidents, drowsiness and distractedness are among the most consequential. In this paper, we use a multimodal dataset consisting of 11 recorded channels over 45 subjects to model driver's drowsiness and distraction. Our work puts forward the application of this dataset by using segmented windows as features, resulting in four main contributions. We explore the performance of each individual modality and specify which signals and features have a better capability of detecting drowsiness and different kinds of distractions. In addition, we analyze the effects of early fusion on the classification of the driver's state using multiple physiological and thermal channels. Finally, we use cascaded late fusion and test three voting strategies to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach. Our results confirm the effectiveness of utilizing a multimodal approach in detecting both drowsiness and distraction as two separate factors influencing the driver and provide guidelines on which signals are appropriate for detecting different driver's states.",1
Reconsidering screening thresholds in health assessments for obstructive sleep apnea using operational and safety incident data,"The rail industry in Australia screens workers for probable obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to known safety risks. However, existing criteria to trigger screening only identify a small proportion of workers with OSA. The current study sought to examine the relationship between OSA risk and rail incidents in real-world data from Australian train drivers, and conducted a proof of concept analysis to determine whether more conservative screening criteria are justified. Health assessment (2016-2018) and subsequent rail incident data (2016-2020) were collected from two passenger rail service providers. Predictors included OSA status (confirmed no OSA with a sleep study, controlled OSA, unknown OSA [no recorded sleep assessment data] and confirmed OSA with no indication of treatment); OSA risk according to the current Standard, and OSA risk according to more conservative clinical markers (BMI threshold and cardiometabolic burden). Coded rail safety incidents involving the train driver were included. Data were analysed using zero-inflated negative binomial models to account for over-dispersion with high 0 counts, and rail safety incidents are reported using Incidence Risk Ratios (IRRs). A total of 751 train drivers, typically middle-aged, overweight to obese and mostly men, were included in analyses. There were 43 (5.7%) drivers with confirmed OSA, 62 (8.2%) with controlled OSA, 13 (1.7%) with confirmed no OSA and 633 (84.4%) drivers with unknown OSA. Of the 633 train drivers with unknown OSA status, 21 (3.3%) met 'at risk' criteria for OSA according to the Standard, and incidents were 61% greater (IRR: 1.61, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.02-2.56) in the years following their health assessment compared to drivers who did not meet 'at risk' criteria. A more conservative OSA risk status using lower BMI threshold and cardiometabolic burden identified an additional 30 'at risk' train drivers who had 46% greater incidents compared to drivers who did not meet risk criteria (IRR (95% CI) 1.46 (1.00-2.13)). Our more conservative OSA risk criteria identified more workers, with greater prospective incidents. These findings suggest that existing validated tools could be considered in future iterations of the Standard in order to more sensitively screen for OSA.",1
Analysis of brain and muscle activity during low-level tooth clenching - a feasibility study with a novel biting device,"In electromyographic (EMG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, muscle and brain activity was compared during low levels of tooth clenching using a novel biting device to control bite force. A total of 21 healthy subjects performed motor tasks, comprising tooth clenching at 5, 10 and 20N. During all measurements, subjects kept the novel bite device between the anterior teeth during tooth clenching. The EMG study (n=15) characterised jaw muscle activity for the three motor tasks and demonstrated significant differences in root mean square (RMS) EMG amplitude between 5-, 10- and 20-N tooth clenching (F=46.21, P<0.001). There were no differences in variability of muscle activity between the three tooth-clenching levels. In an fMRI pilot study (n=6), statistical comparisons were used to identify brain regions with significant activation in the subtraction of baseline from 5- or 20-N tooth-clenching activity. 5- and 20-N tooth clenching significantly and bilaterally activated the sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, cerebellum and basal ganglia (P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). However, activation of each brain region did not differ significantly between two tooth-clenching tasks. Based on these preliminary findings, we propose that the novel biting device may be useful in further fMRI studies on controlled jaw muscle activation patterns in different craniofacial pain conditions. In addition, our fMRI result suggests that there are no significant differences in brain activity within low levels of tooth clenching with controlled force.",0
OPTIMISATION OF CONDUCTOR SYSTEM DESIGN TO MINIMISE WELLHEAD FATIGUE ISSUES,"Current market trends in the construction of newbuild drilling rigs indicate that the market is driven by demand for ultra-deepwater capacity semi-submersible rigs and drillships. These drilling vessels have capacity to drill in water depths of up to 12,000ft and possibly beyond in the near future. With increase in water depth capacity, more complex and heavier BOP stacks are required. Many modem drilling vessels are now incorporating BOPs with capacities of 20ksi pressure and up to 7 shear/seal rams incorporated. This leads to increased height and weight in the BOP. Whilst newbuild drilling vessels will be required to operate in water depths from 1,500ft to 12,000ft whilst on DP mode, deepwater semi-submersible drilling rigs will also have capability for operation in water depths <1,500ft using conventional mooring. Recent experience with modem deepwater rigs with large BOP stacks in water depth of 1,500ft or less suggests increased risk of fatigue when compared to 3rd generation rigs. If future trends continue with larger BOP stacks being designed then the problem of wellhead fatigue with modem deepwater drilling vessels is likely to become more acute.As noted in previous studies the water depth at drillsite has a major impact on the level of fatigue accumulated in the wellhead system. The main driver for this has been found to be the height and weight of the BOP. With requirements for newbuild drilling rigs for 12,000ft water depth capacity being the industry norm, and with increased requirements for BOP functionality, the gap between wellhead loading from 3rd generation and 6th generation rigs is widening. Given that many 3rd generation rigs will likely be decommissioned in the coming years then the usage of 6th generation rigs for shallow water operations will only become more commonplace due to rig availability. Thus, unless market conditions dictate the construction of smaller and lighter BOP stacks, the design of shallow water wells will be critical to ensure fatigue loading on the wellhead and conductor is kept to a minimum.This paper presents a summary of the results of a series of parameter studies carried out to assess a range of options for optimisation of casing and conductor design for 6th generation rigs in shallow water. Various recommendations are made as part of this study as to the addition of supplemental casing and conductor strings of varying sizes and wall thickness to ensure a robust conductor system design for fatigue performance.",0
Primary Prevention of Weight Gain Among New Bus Operators Results of the Success & Health Impacts For Transit operators during Onboarding (SHIFT Onboard) Pilot Study,"ObjectiveThis study aimed to test the feasibility and efficacy of an enhanced onboarding intervention to prevent weight gain and support the early job success of new bus operators.MethodsControl participants (n = 9) completed usual practice new employee training and onboarding. Intervention participants (n = 14) completed five supplemental trainings and four online challenges during their first year. Primary outcomes were body weight, dietary behaviors, physical activity, and sleep duration/quality. Early job success was evaluated with measures of newcomer adjustment.ResultsThe difference between intervention and control participants in body weight change at 12-month was -6.71 lb (Cohen's d = -1.35). Differences in health behavior changes were mixed, but newcomer adjustment changes favored the intervention group.ConclusionsResults support the feasibility of enhanced onboarding for bus operators to prevent worsening health while simultaneously advancing their success as new employees.",0
Evolution of Phase Composition and Durometric Characteristics in the Refractory Titanium Ti-6.4Al-3.5Zr-2.6Sn-1Nb-0.6Mo-2Si Alloy under Aging,"The evolution of phase composition and hardness in the refractory titanium VT18U alloy (Ti-6.4Al-3.5Zr-2.6Sn-1Nb-0.6Mo-0.2Si) during aging for 1 h within a temperature range of 550-700 degrees C has been studied by optical, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy; full-profile X-ray diffraction analysis; and durometry. An explanation is given to some specific features of changes in the crystal lattice constants (unit cell parameters) (beta, alpha', alpha(II), alpha(I) , and alpha(2)) calculated by means of full-profile analysis for the phases formed under high-temperature treatment at 915 degrees C and further aging in alloy VT18U. It has been shown that a maximum hardness at 650 degrees C in aged alloy VT18U is correlated with a maximum amount of alpha(2)-precipitates, which are formed at this temperature and detected by means of full-profile analysis. For an pilot VT18U-based alloy with an increased content of zirconium (7 wt %) and tin (4 wt %), some morphological features in the precipitation of alpha(II) and alpha(2)-phases have been established alongside with regularities of transformations due to doping with aluminum, zirconium, and tin in the phases (beta, alpha(II), alpha(I), alpha(2)) formed during aging at 700 degrees C for 100 h.",0
Recognition of the fatigue status of pilots using BF-PSO optimized multi-class GP classification with sEMG signals,"Air crashes caused by human factors pose a problem. Many researchers have focused on aviation human factors and found that pilots' fatigue status is the key factor. In this study, a hybrid multi-class Gaussian process model is proposed to identify the fatigue status of pilots by analyzing the surface electromyogram signals on the back of their neck and upper arm muscles. Instead of using the traditional conjugate gradient technique to determine the optimal parameters, a hybrid bacterial foraging and particle swarm method is proposed to optimize the unknown parameters to improve the classification accuracy of the multi-class Gaussian process. In the proposed method, the entropy-based features are extracted by wavelet translation from the collected signals to estimate the fatigue status of pilots. Experiments are performed through flight simulation in a full-flight simulator to provide three situations for the fatigue level of the subjects. Comparison of experimental results validates the feasibility of the proposed method to identify the fatigue status of pilots and the further enhancements by the proposed classification system in terms of classification accuracy. Results also show that the developed method helps prevent air crashes caused by pilots' fatigue.",1
Parent-administered pediatric Tuina for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms in preschool children: A pilot randomized controlled trial embedded with a process evaluation,"Background: Beneficial effects of parent-administered pediatric tuina on ADHD in children have been reported in previous studies, but no rigorously designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted on it. Objective: To assess the feasibility and preliminary effects of parent-administered pediatric tuina for ADHD symptoms in preschoolers. Methods: This project was a two-arm, parallel, open-label, pilot RCT. Sixty-four participants were randomized into two groups at a 1:1 ratio. Parents in the parent-administered tuina group (n = 32) attended an online training program on pediatric tuina for ADHD and conduct this intervention on their children at home. Parents in the parent-child interaction group (n = 32) attended an online training about progressive muscle relaxation exercise and carried out parent-child interactive physical activities with their children at home. Both interventions were carried out every other day during a two-month intervention period, with each manipulation for at least 20 min. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment rate, consent rate, participants' adherence, retention rate, and adverse event. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 8. The primary outcome measure was the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham parent scale (SNAP); the secondary outcomes included preschool anxiety scale, children's sleep habits questionnaire, and parental stress scale. A mixed-method process evaluation embedded within the outcome evaluation was performed. Results: The recruitment rate was 12.8 per month. The consent rate was 98.5%. Good adherence was shown from the parent logbook. Four participants withdraw from the study. No severe adverse event was reported. For the SNAP total score, both groups showed improvement with moderate within-group effect size (Cohen's d > 0.5, all p < 0.001) and the between-group effect size was minimal (d(ppc2)< 0.2, p > 0.05). Perceived improvements on children's appetite and sleep quality, and parent-child relationship was observed from the qualitative data. Conclusions: The study design and the parent-administered pediatric tuina intervention were feasible. Parent administered pediatric tuina provided beneficial effects on improving core hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms in preschool children. Parents perceived improvements on children's appetite and sleep quality. Further large-scale are warranted.",0
Driver Fatigue Detection : A Survey,"Driver fatigue is among the most common causes for serious road accidents around the world. This is particularly evident in the transportation industry, where a driver of a heavy vehicle is often exposed to hours of monotonous driving which can result in fatigue without frequent rest periods. Due to the frequent occurrence of driver fatigue related accidents, this has become an area of great socio-economic concern. Detecting driver fatigue has been a research topic for many years, with many approaches being studied thus far. This paper provides an overview of the current existing methods and approaches for detecting driver fatigue.",1
"Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation reduces pain and fatigue in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot trial","Objectives Musculoskeletal pain and fatigue are common features in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is a physiological mechanism diminishing inflammation, engaged by stimulating the vagus nerve. We evaluated the effects of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation in patients with SLE and with musculoskeletal pain.Methods 18 patients with SLE and with musculoskeletal pain >= 4 on a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale were randomised (2:1) in this double-blind study to receive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) or sham stimulation (SS) for 4 consecutive days. Evaluations at baseline, day 5 and day 12 included patient assessments of pain, disease activity (PtGA) and fatigue. Tender and swollen joint counts and the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) were completed by a physician blinded to the patient's therapy. Potential biomarkers were evaluated.Results taVNS and SS were well tolerated. Subjects receiving taVNS had a significant decrease in pain and fatigue compared with SS and were more likely (OR=25, p=0.02) to experience a clinically significant reduction in pain. PtGA, joint counts and PGA also improved. Pain reduction and improvement of fatigue correlated with the cumulative current received. In general, responses were maintained through day 12. Plasma levels of substance P were significantly reduced at day 5 compared with baseline following taVNS but other neuropeptides, serum and whole blood-stimulated inflammatory mediators, and kynurenine metabolites showed no significant change at days 5 or 12 compared with baseline.Conclusion taVNS resulted in significantly reduced pain, fatigue and joint scores in SLE. Additional studies evaluating this intervention and its mechanisms are warranted.",0
"A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of an Intervention to Promote Psychological Well-Being in Critically Ill Children: Soothing Through Touch, Reading, and Music","Objectives: To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a PICU Soothing intervention using touch, reading, and music.Design: Nonblinded, pilot randomized controlled trial.Setting: The PICU and medical-surgical wards of one Canadian pediatric hospital.Patients: Twenty PICU patients age 2-14 years old and their parents, randomized to an intervention group (n = 10) or control group (n = 10).Intervention: PICU Soothing consisted of: 1) parental comforting (touch and reading), followed by 2) a quiet period with music via soft headbands, administered once daily throughout hospitalization.Measurements and Main Results: Acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and methods were assessed via participation rates, observation, measurement completion rates, semistructured interviews, and telephone calls. Psychological well-being was assessed using measures of distress, sleep, and child and parent anxiety in the PICU, on the wards and 3 months post discharge. Forty-four percent of parents agreed to participate. Seventy percent and 100% of intervention group parents responded positively to comforting and music, respectively. Most intervention group parents (70%) and all nurses felt children responded positively. All nurses found the intervention acceptable and feasible. Measurement completion rates ranged from 70% to 100%. Pilot data suggested lower intervention group child and parent anxiety after transfer to hospital wards.Conclusions: PICU Soothing is acceptable and feasible to conduct. Results support the implementation of a full-scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate intervention effectiveness.",0
Malaria incidence and entomological findings in an area targeted for a cluster-randomized controlled trial to prevent malaria in Ethiopia: results from a pilot study,"Background: This study was part of the work to prepare for a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of combining indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets on malaria incidence. A pilot study was done to estimate the variations of malaria incidence among villages, combined with entomological collections and an assessment of susceptibility to insecticides in malaria vectors.Methods: A cohort of 5309 residents from four kebeles (the lowest government administrative unit) in 996 households was followed from August to December 2013 in south-central Ethiopia. Blood samples were collected by a finger prick for a microscopic examination of malaria infections. A multilevel mixed effect model was applied to measure the predictors of malaria episode. Adult mosquitoes were collected using light traps set indoors close to a sleeping person, pyrethrum spray sheet catches and artificial outdoor pit shelters. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to detect the sources of mosquito blood meals, while mosquito longevity was estimated based on parity. The World Health Organization's tube bioassay test was used to assess the insecticide susceptibility status of malaria vectors to pyrethroids and carbamates.Results: The average incidence of malaria episode was 4.6 per 10,000 person weeks of observation. The age group from 5 to 14 years (IRR = 2.7; 95 % CI 1.1-6.6) and kebeles near a lake or river (IRR = 14.2, 95 % CI 3.1-64) were significantly associated with malaria episode. Only 271 (27.3 %) of the households owned insecticide-treated nets. Of 232 adult Anopheles mosquitoes collected, Anopheles arabiensis (71.1 %) was the predominant species. The average longevity of An. arabiensis was 14 days (range: 7-25 human blood index days). The overall human blood index (0.69) for An. arabiensis was higher than the bovine blood index (0.38). Statistically significant differences in Anopheline mosquitoes abundance were observed between the kebeles (P = 0.001). Anopheles arabiensis was susceptible to propoxur, but resistant to pyrethroids. However, An. pharoensis was susceptible to all pyrethroids and carbamates tested.Conclusions: This study showed a high variation in malaria incidence and Anopheles between kebeles. The observed susceptibility of the malaria vectors to propoxur warrants using this insecticide for indoor residual spraying, and the results from this study will be used as a baseline for the trial.",0
Feasibility and efficacy of home-based neurofunctional exercise vs. resistance exercise programs for ambulatory disability of multiple sclerosis patients with cognitive impairment,"Background: Ambulatory disability and cognitive impairment are common and co-occuring manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS). Neurofunctional training is a specific intervention performed in realistic environments that may have beneficial effects on ambulatory disability in persons with MS who have cognitive impairment. This pilot sudy investigated the feasibility and efficacy of an eight-week home-based neurofunctional training (HBNFT) program vs. home-based resistance training (HBRT) on ambulatory performance in MS patients with cognitive impairment.Methods: Thirty males/females with MS (age 18-50 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score <= 6, and processing speed score <= 41.5 as a marker of cognitive impairment) were randomly assigned into HBNFT and HBRT groups. After one week (three sessions) of center-based, supervised training for learning the programs and maximizing safety, the participants completed eight weeks (three sessions per week) of the home-based training programs. The programs were supported through videos, brochures and Digital Video Discs (DVDs) provided during clinic visits (weeks 1 and 5). Ambulatory performance (tandem stance test; tandem walk test; timed up-and-go (TUG); six-minute walk test (6MWT), 10- meter walking test (10MWT); timed 25 foot walk test (T25FWT); five times sit to stand test (5TSTS); six spot step test (SSST); and hand grip) was measured before and after the exercise programs. Feasibility and acceptability of exercise programs was assessed after the eight-week period.Results: HBNFT significantly improved tandem walk test (P = 0.018), SSST (P = 0.026), and 6MWT (P = 0.037) compared with HBRT. No significant changes or differences were observed in other outcomes (P > 0.05). HBNFT was well tolerated and resulted in no adverse events, whereas there were reports of pain, muscle cramps, and extreme fatigue among HBRT participant.Conclusion: The current pilot study provided initial support for HBNFT as a safe and feasible approach for improving some aspects of ambulation in persons with MS who have cognitive impairment. Such a pilot study provides initial proof-of-concept data for the design and implementation of an appropriately-powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) of neuro-functional training vs. traditional resistance exercise in a larger sample of persons with MS who present with co-occurring impairments in mobility and cognition.",0
"Velopharyngeal incompetence in patients with cleft palate, flexible video pharyngoscopy and perceptual speech assessment: a correlational pilot study","Objectives: To assess the role of video endoscopy in evaluating velopharyngeal incompetence and investigate a possible relationship between velopharyngeal incompetence type and speech defect in cleft palate patients.Methods: A prospective study of 28 pre- or post-operative cleft palate patients with speech defects who attended Plastic Surgery-Cleft Palate and ENT out-patient clinics was performed. The velar defect type was determined using a flexible endoscope and findings were video recorded. Speech pathology was assessed using the cleft palate audit protocol for speech.Results: A significant, clinically relevant relationship was noted between the perceived characteristics of hypernasality and velopharyngeal insufficiency type. Hypernasal speech was a definite clinical indicator of velopharyngeal incompetence, and the type 1 velopharyngeal defect was most common. Type 1 velopharyngeal coronal-type dysfunction was strongly associated with hypernasality (p < 0.05). When speech substitution was noted, type 2 velopharyngeal (or sagittal) incompetence could be predicted (p < 0.05).Conclusion: In the management of cleft palate patients, it is important that surgical correction of the defect and achieving velopharyngeal competency for speech are performed simultaneously. Pre-operative velopharyngeal endoscopy with speech assessment will define the anatomical and functional bases for velopharyngeal correction and assist in planning and tailoring the pharyngeal flap.",0
Evaluation of a smart algorithm for commercial vehicle driver drowsiness detection,Drowsiness is a safety hazard in commercial vehicle driving. The conditions to which truck drivers are exposed put them at higher risk as compared to passenger car drivers. Unobtrusive drowsiness detection methods can avoid catastrophic crashes by warning or assisting the drivers. This paper describes an experimental analysis of commercially licensed drivers who were subjected to drowsiness conditions in a truck driving simulator and evaluates the performance of a neural network based algorithm which monitors only the drivers' steering input Correlations are found between the change in steering and the state of drowsiness. The results show steering signals differences can be used effectively for detection.,1
EEG-Based Index for Timely Detecting User's Drowsiness Occurrence in Automotive Applications,"Human errors are widely considered among the major causes of road accidents. Furthermore, it is estimated that more than 90% of vehicle crashes causing fatal and permanent injuries are directly related to mental tiredness, fatigue, and drowsiness of the drivers. In particular, driving drowsiness is recognized as a crucial aspect in the context of road safety, since drowsy drivers can suddenly lose control of the car. Moreover, the driving drowsiness episodes mostly appear suddenly without any prior behavioral evidence. The present study aimed at characterizing the onset of drowsiness in car drivers by means of a multimodal neurophysiological approach to develop a synthetic electroencephalographic (EEG)-based index, able to detect drowsy events. The study involved 19 participants in a simulated scenario structured in a sequence of driving tasks under different situations and traffic conditions. The experimental conditions were designed to induce prominent mental drowsiness in the final part. The EEG-based index, so-called MDrow index, was developed and validated to detect the driving drowsiness of the participants. The MDrow index was derived from the Global Field Power calculated in the Alpha EEG frequency band over the parietal brain sites. The results demonstrated the reliability of the proposed MDrow index in detecting the driving drowsiness experienced by the participants, resulting also more sensitive and timely sensible with respect to more conventional autonomic parameters, such as the EyeBlinks Rate and the Heart Rate Variability, and to subjective measurements (self-reports).",1
Effect of Pilates Training on People With Fibromyalgia Syndrome: A Pilot Study,"Altan L, Korkmaz N, Bingol U, Gunay B. Effect of Pilates training on people with fibromyalgia syndrome: a pilot study. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2009;90:1983-8.Objective: To investigate the effects of Pilates on pain, functional status, and quality of life in fibromyalgia, which is known to be a chronic musculoskeletal disorder.Design: Randomized, prospective, controlled, and single-blind trial.Setting: Physical medicine and rehabilitation department.Participants: Women (N=50) who had a diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria.Intervention: The participants were randomly assigned into 2 groups. In group 1, a Pilates exercise program of I hour was given by a certified trainer to 25 participants 3 times a week for 12 weeks. In group 2, which was designed as the control group, 25 participants were given a home exercise (relaxation/stretching) program. In both groups, pre- (week 0) and posttreatment (week 12 and week 24) evaluation was performed by one of the authors, who was blind to the group allocation.Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measures were pain (visual analog scale) and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). Exploratory outcome measures were number of tender points, algometric score, chair test, and Nottingham Health Profile.Results: Twenty-five Pilates exercise and 24 relaxation/stretching exercise participants completed the study. In group 1, significant improvement was observed in both pain and FIQ at week 12 but only in FIQ at 24 weeks. In group 2, no significant improvement was obtained in pain and FIQ at week 12 and week 24. Comparison of the 2 groups showed significantly superior improvement in pain and FIQ in group 1 at week 12 but no difference between the 2 groups at week 24.Conclusions: We suggest Pilates as an effective and safe method for people with FMS. Our study is the first clinical study designed to investigate the role of the Pilates method in FMS treatment. We believe that further research with more participants and longer follow-up periods could help assess the therapeutic value of this popular physical exercise method.",0
Development of a design verification methodology including strength and fatigue life prediction for agricultural tractors,"During the operations of an agricultural tractor, front axle and front axle support encounter the worst load conditions of the whole tractor. If the design of these components is not verified by systematic engineering approach, the operators of the tractor may face with sudden failures. This paper aims to develop a verification method, which involves testing an agricultural tractor on a special test track and agricultural field and together with the computer aided engineering analysis, in order to prevent such failures in the lifetime of the agricultural tractor. For this purpose, a strain gage data acquisition system has been designed to measure the strain values on the component in order to determine maximum principle stresses for the calculation of overload safety on the agricultural field and stress data for the prediction of fatigue life on a radial washboard test track. The cycle number of these stress data for the fatigue analysis has been established by rainflow cycle counting method. Total fatigue damage for the front axle support has been calculated considering damage accumulation hypothesis defined by Miner.",0
A brain-computer interface based semi-autonomous robotic system,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) takes commands directly from the users brain via electroencephalogram (EEG), which offers a solution for controlling the robotic system when users hands are disabled or occupied. This paper describes a semi-autonomous robotic system that is able to execute grasping tasks based on BCI, thus offering an alternative control approach for robotic system. As BCI has limited information transfer rate and can easily cause fatigue in using, we utilize a stereo camera for object localization and convolutional neural network (you only look once version3, YOLOv3) for object identification to reduce the information needed from the brain in task execution, thus alleviating the workload for the user as well as increasing the efficiency of the system.",0
Clinical reminder alert fatigue in healthcare: a systematic literature review protocol using qualitative evidence,"Background: Integrated reminders within clinical systems have become more prevalent due to the use of electronic health records and evidence demonstrating an increase in compliance within practice. Clinical reminders are assessed for effectiveness on an individual basis, rather than in combination with existing prompts for other conditions. The growing number of prompts may be counter-productive as healthcare professionals are increasingly suffering from reminder fatigue meaning many reminders are ignored. This work will review the qualitative evidence to identify barriers and enablers of existing prompts found within computerised decision support systems. Our focus will be on primary care where clinicians have to negotiate a plethora of reminders as they deal with increasingly complex patients and sophisticated treatment regimes. The review will provide a greater understanding of existing systems and the way clinicians interact with them to inform the development of more effective and targeted clinical reminders.Methods: A comprehensive search using piloted terms will be used to identify relevant literature from 1960 (or commencement of database) to 2017. MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process, EMBASE, HMIC, PsycINFO, CDSR DARE, HTA, CINAHL and CPCI, will be searched, as well as grey literature and references and citations of included papers. Manuscripts will be assessed for eligibility, bias and quality using the CASP tool with narrative data being included and questionnaire based studies excluded. Inductive thematic analysis will be performed in order to produce a conceptual framework defining the key barriers around integrated clinical reminders.Discussion: Indications of alert and reminder fatigue are found throughout the current literature. However, this has not been fully investigated using a robust qualitative approach, particularly in a rapidly growing body of evidence. This review will aid people forming new clinical systems so that alerts can be incorporated appropriately.",0
The influence of temperature and interior ambient lighting color on nighttime driving performance,"Interior ambient lighting has been applied in high-end vehicles to improve driving experience and emotion, owing to the drivers' perceptions of interior spaciousness and ability to control the vehicle interior environment. Although the influence of temperature and lighting is well-documented in buildings, their effects on driving remain underexplored. Drawing on the hue-heat hypothesis, this study examines the impact of ambient temperatures and interior lighting conditions on driving performance and environmental perception, focusing on their independent and interactive effects. Seventy-two drivers were randomly assigned to three temperature groups (18 degrees C, 23 degrees C, and 28 degrees C) and completed driving tasks in a high-fidelity simulator under varying interior lighting conditions (red, blue, warm white, and cool white). Performance was assessed alongside secondary tasks to simulate real-world driving distractions. Post-task surveys gauged sleepiness, environmental satisfaction, task load, and emotional state. The results show that temperature significantly affects driving performance, cognitive tasks, and environmental perception. Moderate temperatures were preferred for comfort, while higher temperatures impaired accuracy and increased cognitive strain. Metrics like pitch, speed variability, and gas pedal usage were also temperature sensitive. Conversely, lighting condition did not significantly influence driving performance, cognitive tasks, or environmental perception, providing no evidence to support the hue-heat hypothesis. Furthermore, no significant interaction effects were found between temperatures and lighting conditions on any of these metrics, confirming their independent impact. The study underscores the significant role of temperature in influencing driving behavior and perception, while confirming that non-significant effect of lighting condition on driving performance.",0
Word Learning as a Window to Memory and Rehabilitation Outcomes in Traumatic Brain Injury,"Purpose: The purpose of this viewpoint is to advocate for increased study of word learning abilities and word learning interventions in traumatic brain injury (TBI).Method: We describe the word learning process and the unique opportunities afforded by studying each component and stage. Building on discussions at the 2022 International Cognitive-Communication Disorders Conference, we describe how word learning may underlie a variety of functional outcomes after TBI, making it a promising target for rehabilitation. Finally, we discuss principles that may guide study in this critical area to advance outcomes after TBI for children and adults.Results: Word learning is a dynamic and iterative process taking place over time and in multiple stages. Thus, studying word learning affords the opportunity to parse the relative contributions of multiple memory systems to different phases and components of the process. However, single-timepoint designs are insufficient to capture the full word learning process, which occurs over time and across contexts. Word learning also presents an opportunity to assess the contributions of behavioral and lifestyle factors (e.g., sleep and exercise) to different memory phases. Understanding these interactions could drive clinical interventions aimed at improving memory through manipulable external behaviors.Conclusions: Word learning is key to success in functional spheres across the life span. The importance of words to daily life remains after TBI, even as the memory systems that support word learning are disrupted. The empirical study of word learning and rehabilitation of word learning deficits in TBI presents a promising new direction in understanding the breadth of neurogenic cognitivecommunication disorders and an opportunity to explore a potential driver of functional outcome and impactful rehabilitation target.",0
Role of acupuncture in the management of diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN): a pilot RCT,"Aims To examine the role of acupuncture in the treatment of diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN) using a single-blind, placebo-controlled RCT and to collect data that would be required in a future definitive study of the efficacy of acupuncture in DPN.Methods 45 patients were allocated to receive a 10-week course either of real (53%) or sham (47%) acupuncture. Five standardised acupuncture points on the lower limb of each leg were used in the study: LR3, KI3, SP6, SP10 and ST36. Outcome measures included the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) scale, lower limb pain (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS); Sleep Problem Scale (SPS); Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP); 36-item Short Form 36 Health Survey and resting blood pressure (BP).Results Over the 10-week treatment period, small improvements were seen in VAS - 15 (-26 to -3.5), MYMOP -0.89 (-1.4 to -0.3), SPS -2.5 (-4.2 to -0.82) and resting diastolic BP -5.2 (-10.4 to -0.14) in the true acupuncture group. In contrast, there was little change in those receiving sham acupuncture. A moderate treatment effect in favour of active acupuncture was detected in MYMOP scores -0.66 (-0.96 to -0.35) but nonsignificant effect sizes in LANSS Pain Scale -0.37 (-2.2 to 1.4), resting diastolic BP -0.50 (-3.0 to 1.99) and the SPS -0.51 (-2.2 to 1.16).Conclusions We have demonstrated the practicality and feasibility of acupuncture as an additional treatment for people with DPN. The treatment was well tolerated with no appreciable side effects. Larger randomised trials are needed to confirm the clinical and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of DPN.",0
Objective physical activity and self-reported quality of life in patients receiving palliative chemotherapy,"There is little objective data on how cancer and its therapy affect physical activity. The main aims of this Pilot study were 1) to compare physical activity in patients receiving palliative chemotherapy and healthy controls, and 2) to explore the relationship between patients' activity, quality of life (QoL), and clinical performance status. A miniaturized electronic meter objectively recorded activity for one week in 20 patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy and in 13 age-matched healthy controls. Patients also completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQC30, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F; fatigue), and Functional Assessment of Anorexia and Cachexia Therapy (FAACT; anorexia/cachexia) quality-of-life questionnaires. The patients' median estimated total energy expenditure was 8 % lower (P = 0.0003), median time spent upright was approximately two hours/day less (P = 0.0002), and median steps taken/day was 43 % lower (P = 0.002) than that of the control group. Neither estimated energy expenditure nor average steps taken/day correlated significantly with EORTC QLQC30 physical functioning, ftiligue, or global health status/QoL. There was no correlation with the FAACT Trial Outcome Index (TOI), but the FACIT-F TOI and both estimated energy expenditure and the average steps taken/day correlated significantly (r = 0. 59, P = 0. 009 and r = 0.59, P = 0.008). It is concluded that patients receiving palliative chemotherapy were less active than healthy controls; however the relationship between physical activity",0
Radar-based sleep stage classification in children undergoing polysomnography: a pilot-study,"Study objectives: Unobtrusive monitoring of sleep and sleep disorders in children presents challenges. We investigated the possibility of using Ultra-Wide band (UWB) radar to measure sleep in children.Methods: Thirty-two children scheduled to undergo a clinical polysomnography participated; their ages ranged from 2 months to 14 years. During the polysomnography, the children's body movements and breathing rate were measured by an UWB-radar. A total of 38 features were calculated from the motion signals and breathing rate obtained from the raw radar signals. Adaptive boosting was used as machine learning classifier to estimate sleep stages, with polysomnography as gold standard method for comparison.Results: Data of all participants combined, this study achieved a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.67 and an overall accuracy of 89.8% for wake and sleep classification, a Kappa of 0.47 and an accuracy of 72.9% for wake, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep classification, and a Kappa of 0.43 and an accuracy of 58.0% for wake, REM sleep, light sleep and deep sleep classification.Conclusion: Although the current performance is not sufficient for clinical use yet, UWB radar is a promising method for non-contact sleep analysis in children.

Comparative utility of instruments for monitoring sleepiness-related performance decrements in the operational environment,"As both military and commercial operations increasingly become continuous, 24-h-per-day enterprises, the likelihood of operator errors or inefficiencies caused by sleep loss and/or circadian desynchrony also increases. Avoidance of such incidents requires the timely application of appropriate interventions - which, in turn, depend on the ability to measure and monitor the performance capacity of individuals in the operational environment. Several factors determine the potential suitability of candidate measures, including their relative sensitivity, reliability, content validity, intrusiveness and cumbersomeness/fieldability. In the present study, the relative sensitivity (defined as the ratio of effect size to 95% confidence interval) of several measures to the effects of sleep loss was compared in a sleep restriction experiment, in which groups were allowed 3, 5, 7, or 9 h time in bed (TIB) across seven consecutive nights. Of the measures compared, the Psychomotor Vigilance Test was among the most sensitive to sleep restriction, was among the most reliable with no evidence of learning over repeated administrations, and possesses characteristics that make it among the most practical for use in the operational environment.",1
Established and novel measures of upper limb impairment in children with Charcot-Marie-tooth disease type 1A and riboflavin transporter deficiency type 2,"Hand function is a problem in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and Riboflavin Transporter Deficiency type 2 (RTD2). However, a detailed understanding of upper limb involvement in these conditions is lacking. The aim of this pilot study was to compare hand and upper limb function between children with CMT1A, RTD2 and healthy controls using established and novel outcome measures. Three age-and sex-matched groups of four children (5-15years, 1 male/group) with CMT1A, RTD2, and healthy controls were assessed for function, strength, and sensation. Fatigue and muscle activity of the FDI was also assessed using a submaximal contraction at 40% of the participants' maximal voluntary contraction. Functional measures were most affected in children with RTD2 followed by children with CMT1A, compared to healthy controls. Strength was similarly impaired in CMT1A and RTD2 compared to controls (p<0.05). Sensation was significantly impaired in RTD2 compared to CMT1A and controls (p=0.008). While time to fatigue did not differ between groups, a decline in muscle activity while force remained constant showed that controls compensated with other muscles during the fatigue task while children with CMT1A and RTD2 did not have this compensatory ability. Children with CMT1A and RTD2 exhibited marked hand/upper limb impairment. These results suggest the upper limb should be a focus of rehabilitative therapy in affected children using sensitive outcome measures of strength and sensation, as well as functional activities of daily living, which are most relevant to the patient.",0
Industrial Application of AI-Based Assistive Magnetic Particle Inspection,"Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) is one of the most used methods in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), allowing precise and robust defect detection on industrial-grade manufactured parts. However, human controllers perform this task in full black environments under UV-A lighting only (with safety glasses) and use chemical products in a confined environment. Those constraints tends to lower control performance and increase stress and fatigue. As a solution, we propose an AI-based assistive machine (called PARADES) inside the hazardous environment, remotely manipulated by a human operator, outside of the confined area, in cleaner and safer conditions. This paper focuses on the development of a complete industrial-grade AI machine, both in terms of hardware and software. The result is a standalone assistive AI-based vision system, plug-and-play and controller-friendly, which only needs the usual power supply 230 V plug that detects defects and measures defect length. In conclusion, the PARADES machines address for the first time the problem of occupational health in MPI with an industrial standalone machine which can work on several parts and be integrated into current production lines. Providing cleaner and healthier working conditions for operators will invariably lead to increased quality of detection. These results suggest that it would be beneficial to spread this kind of AI-based assistive technology in NDT, in particular MPI, but also in Fluorescent Penetrant Testing (FPT) or in visual inspection.",0
"Sunlight Exposure, Work Hours, Caffeine Consumption, and Sleep Duration in the Naval Environment","BACKGROUND: Sailors in the U.S. Navy are habitual shiftworkers, often experiencing circadian misalignment due to their irregular work/rest schedules. This study assessed the effect of sunlight exposure, work hours, and caffeinated beverage consumption on the daily sleep duration of crewmembers of a U.S. Navy ship during a 2-wk underway period.METHODS: Working in an artificially lit area with no access to sunlight during work hours, U.S. Navy crew members (N = 91) used daily logs to report their daily activity, caffeinated beverage consumption, and exposure to sunlight while off-duty; sleep was assessed by wrist-worn actigraphy.RESULTS: Hours of sunlight exposure, work duration, and the amount of coffee/tea/soft drinks were statistically significant predictors of sleep duration. On average, crewmembers who reported more than one half-hour of sunlight each day slept on average similar to 40 min (10%) less than their peers working the same shifts who received less than one half-hour of sunlight (on average 6.05 +/- 0.90 h vs. 6.71 +/- 0.91 h, respectively).DISCUSSION: Exposure to sunlight, work hours, and consumption of caffeinated beverages are important factors when planning watchstanding schedules at sea. Even though further research is needed, our results suggest that even brief exposure to sunlight may contribute to circadian misalignment that negatively affects sleep in the operational environment. Educating crewmembers about sleep hygiene, especially the important roles played by sunlight and caffeine, could potentially improve the sleep and fatigue levels of this population of maritime shiftworkers.",0
Sleep in Hospitalized Elders: A Pilot Study,"Hospitalized elders frequently experience disturbed sleep related to environmental factors. To determine relationships between sleep and environmental noise and light, a descriptive exploratory study was conducted with 48 hospitalized older adults. Participants aged 70 years or older were monitored for sleep via wrist actigraphy, and noise and light levels were measured the first night of hospitalization. Sleep time was brief (mean, 3.75 hours) and fragmented (mean, 13 awakenings per night). The sleep environment was noisy with a median sound level of 49.65 dB(A). There was an average of 3 periods of elevated light levels (mean, 64 lux) lasting an average of 1.75 hours each night. No significant correlation was found among sleep and age, light, and sound. Recommendations include light and sound reduction measures and dedicated do not disturb times to allow for a full 90-minute sleep cycle. (Geriatr Nurs 2010;31: 263-271)",0
"Serum Calcium and Magnesium Levels, Not 25-Hydroxyvitamin D, Are Associated With Sleep Quality in Airline Pilots.","INTRODUCTION: Despite the vulnerability of airline pilots (APs) to sleep disturbances, the biological underpinnings responsible for this phenomenon are still not entirely elucidated. However, there is an increasing amount of evidence indicating an association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D, Ca2+, and Mg2+ levelsand sleep health. In this cross-sectional study, we sought to examine the potential associations between serum levels of these biomarkers and the occurrence of poor sleep among APs.METHODS: We examined a convenience sample of 100male APs who underwent the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess their sleep quality. Those who scored 5 or higher on the PSQI were labeled as poor sleepers. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were quantified in all participants.RESULTS: Out of the 100 APs, 58 (58%) and 42 (42%) were classified as good and poor sleepers, respectively, based on the PSQI scores. We defined vitamin D deficiency as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 10 ng/mL and insufficiency as levels ranging from 10 to 30 ng/mL. The results revealed no significant differences in serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D between the two groups, and there was no evidence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. However, poor sleepers exhibited significantly lower levels of both Mg2+ (1.8 ± 0.1 mg/dLversus2.0 ± 0.1 mg/dL, respectively) and Ca2+ (8.5 ± 0.4mg/dLversus9.1 ± 0.5 mg/dL, respectively) compared to good sleepers (P < 0.001 for both). Logistic regression analysis identified both Mg2+ and Ca2+ as independent biomarkers associated with poor sleep quality in APs (P < 0.001 for both).CONCLUSION: Lower serum concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+, not 25-hydroxyvitamin D, may be associated with poor sleep in APs.",0
Real-time eye detection and tracking for driver observation under various light conditions,"Eye tracking is one of the key technologies for future driver assistance systems since human eyes contain much information about the driver's condition such as gaze, attention level, and fatigue level. Thus, nonintrusive methods for eye detection and tracking are important for many applications of vision-based driver-automotive interaction. One problem common to many eye tracking methods proposed so far is their sensitivity to lighting condition change. This tends to significantly limit their scope for automotive applications. In this paper we present a new real-time eye detection and tracking method that works under variable and realistic lighting conditions. By combining imaging by using IR light and appearance-based object recognition techniques, our method can robustly track eyes even when the pupils are not very bright due to significant external illumination interferences. The appearance model is incorporated in both eye detection and tracking via the use of a support vector machine and mean shift tracking. Our experimental results show the feasibility of our approach and the validity for the method is extended for drivers wearing sunglasses.",1
Cardiac Autonomic Activity in Commercial Aircrew During an Actual Flight Duty Period,"BACKGROUND: The work schedules of airline crewmembers include extended workdays, compressed work periods, and limited time for recovery, which may lead to cardiovascular strain and fatigue.The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in heart rate variability (HRV) during work and sleep, and with respect to work characteristics and breaks.METHODS: We followed 49 airline crewmembers during four consecutive workdays of >= 39 h. Data included HRV measurements, a questionnaire, and sleep/work diaries. HRV parameters include root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), standard deviation of the normal beat-to-beat differences (SDNN), and the low and high frequency ratio (LF/HF).RESULTS: The results indicate higher levels of cardiovascular strain on the 4th compared to the 1st workday, most prominent among cabin crewmembers. In this group, we observed indications of decreased cardiovascular strain by increasing duration of sleep, demonstrated by increased RMSSD (B = 2.7, 95% CI 1.6, 3.8) and SDNN (B - 4.4, 95% CI 3.0, 5.7), and decreased LF/HF (B = - 0.2, 95% CI, -0.4, -0.01). Similarly, longer duration of breaks was associated with lower cardiovascular strain, indicated by increased RMSSD (B = 0.1, 95% CI 0.03, 0.1) and SDNN (B = 0.1, 95% CI 0.1, 0.1). Among pilots, increased LF/HF indicated higher cardiovascular strain in those who often or always reported of high workload (B = 4.3, 95% CI 2.3, 6.3; and B = 7.3, 95% CI 3 2, 11.4, respectively).DISCUSSION: The results support the contention that the studied work period increases cardiac strain among airline crew. Work characteristics, breaks, and sleep are associated with changes in HRV.",0
Visual neglect: Occurrence and patterns in pilots in a simulated overnight flight,"Introduction: Visual neglect is the unconscious inability to recognize or acknowledge some visual information in the presence of a structurally intact visual system, and was hypothesized to occur with less than 24 h of continuous wakefulness. Visual perception was evaluated in military pilots during a simulated overnight flight to explore for the possible occurrence of visual neglect. Methods: There were eight military pilots (male, 31-52 yr of age, mean 37 yr) on flight status who were recruited to perform the primary task of flying a simulated 12.5 h overnight mission after a day of continuous wakefulness and the secondary task of responding to repeated 20 min presentations of single- and double-light stimuli displayed in random sequence at 15degrees intervals across the cockpit instrument panel. In addition to the visual performance task, simulator shutdowns occurring when the tolerances of the simulator were exceeded were measured and simple reaction time on the psychomotor vigilance task was assessed. Total continuous wakefulness was 26.5 h. Results: Combined performance on the visual perception task showed response omissions increasing at 19 h of continuous wakefulness. Patterns included omissions at all stimulus locations, of primarily peripherally located stimuli, and of one of two simultaneously presented stimuli. Simulator shutdowns began at 21.5 h of continuous wakefulness. Correlation of visual task response omissions with simulator shutdowns was r = 0.95, p < 0.0001. Conclusions: Significant neglect of visual stimuli occurred in pilots beginning at 19 h of continuous wakefulness in a simulated overnight fixed wing aircraft flight, preceded simulator shutdowns, and correlated at 0.95 with simulator shutdowns.",0
Wireless Electroencephalography (EEG) to Monitor Sleep Among Patients Being Withdrawn From Opioids: Evidence of Feasibility and Utility,"Public Health Significance Many people who are withdrawing off of opioids experience severe and clinically significant levels of sleep impairment and insomnia. In order to learn more about sleep impairment and appropriate treatment strategies, we must identify comfortable and precise ways to measure sleep in patients experiencing withdrawal. This study provides initial evidence that a commercially available, wireless, ambulatory EEG sleep monitor was accepted by patients and provided information that was more closely associated with measures of withdrawal than a standard sleep diary.Sleep impairment is a common comorbid and debilitating symptom for persons with opioid use disorder (OUD). Research into underlying mechanisms and efficacious treatment interventions for OUD-related sleep problems requires both precise and physiologic measurements of sleep-related outcomes and impairment. This pilot examined the feasibility of a wireless sleep electroencephalography (EEG) monitor (Sleep Profiler (TM)) to measure sleep outcomes and architecture among participants undergoing supervised opioid withdrawal. Sleep outcomes were compared to a self-reported sleep diary and opioid withdrawal ratings. Participants (n = 8, 100% male) wore the wireless EEG 85.6% of scheduled nights. Wireless EEG detected measures of sleep architecture including changes in total, NREM and REM sleep time during study phases, whereas the diary detected changes in wakefulness only. Direct comparisons of five overlapping outcomes revealed lower sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency and higher awakenings and time spent awake from the wireless EEG versus sleep diary. Associations were evident between wireless EEG and increased withdrawal severity, lower sleep efficiency, less time in REM and non-REM stages 1 and 2, and more hydroxyzine treatment; sleep diary was associated with total sleep time and withdrawal only. Data provide initial evidence that a wireless EEG is a feasible and useful tool for objective monitoring of sleep in persons experiencing acute opioid withdrawal. Data are limited by the small and exclusively male sample, but provide a foundation for using wireless EEG sleep monitors for objective evaluation of sleep-related impairment in persons with OUD in support of mechanistic and treatment intervention research.",0
Eye State Detection for Driver Inattention based on Lucas Kanade Optical Flow Algorithm,"Traffic accidents due to drivers inattention has become one of the major factor in road accidents and highway crashers. The problem has led many researchers to develop drivers monitoring systems which can send warning signals to the drivers. One of the active research area related to this issue involve in determining the drivers mental state based on drivers' facial expressions which is non-intrusive as compared to analysis of brain wave, heart rate, excessive body heat. Apart from that, research on facial expression is expanding to the dynamic analysis whereby the temporal data is taken into consideration to determine the state of mind. Lucas Kanade optical flow is one of the methods that is being used to detect motions of objects. The method is later being proven to be capable of detecting facial features motion. However, there are no specific research being done on sleepiness and eye region motion analysis using Lucas Kanade optical flow method. This paper presents an optical flow using the Lucas Kanade algorithm by measuring optical flow on eye region from video sequences. In this stage, the drivers face and eye region are detected using facial feature detector. The optical flow of the eyes region is then computed. Results show that the proposed method can be applied to extract significant temporal data from the eye region.",1
"Effects of a pulsed electromagnetic therapy on multiple sclerosis fatigue and quality of life: A double-blind, placebo controlled trial","Context . There is a growing literature on the biological and clinical effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields. Some studies suggest that electromagnetic therapies may be useful in the treatment of chronic illnesses. This study is a follow-up to a placebo controlled pilot study in which multiple sclerosis (MS) patients exposed to weak, extremely low frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields showed significant improvements on a composite symptom measure.Objective . To evaluate the effects of a pulsed electromagnetic therapy on MS related fatigue, spasticity, bladder control, and overall quality of life.Design . A multi-site, double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover trial. Each subject received 4 weeks of the active and placebo treatments separated by a 2-week wash out period.Setting . The University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle Wash, the Neurology Center of Fairfax in Fairfax, Va, and the headquarters of the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America in Cherry Hill, NJ.Subjects . 117 patients with clinically definite MS.Intervention . Daily exposure to a small, Portable pulsing electromagnetic field generator.Main Outcome . The MS Quality of Life Inventory (MSQL1) was used to assess changes in fatigue, bladder control, spasticity, and a quality of life composite.Results . Paired t-tests were used to assess treatment differences in the 117 subjects (81% of the initial sample) who completed both treatment sessions. Improvements in fatigue and overall quality of life were significantly greater on the active device. There were no treatment effects for bladder control and a disability composite, and mixed results for spasticity.Conclusions . Evidence from this randomized, double-hind, placebo controlled trial is consistent with results from smaller studies suggesting that exposure to pulsing, weak electromagnetic fields can alleviate symptoms of MS. The clinical effects were small, however, and need to be replicated. Additional research is also needed to examine the possibility that ambulatory patients and patients taking interferons for their MS may he most responsive to this kind of treatment.",0
Gender differences in brachial blood flow during fatiguing intermittent handgrip,"Purpose: Females have been reported to have greater resistance to skeletal muscle fatigue than males. Blood flow, which plays an important role in supplying oxygen and nutrients to working muscles, may play an important role in the mechanisms of gender difference. We hypothesized that females would have greater conduit artery blood flow supplying working muscles than males during intermittent maximal handgrip exercise. Methods: Healthy adult (22-31 yr old) males (N = 8) and females (N = 8), lying in a supine position, repeated static maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with a handgrip device in an intermittent pattern. Mean brachial arterial blood flow (MBABF) was continuously monitored using Doppler ultrasonography during the 5-s muscle-relaxation phase, when intramuscular pressure does not impede measurement of muscle blood flow during the 4-min exercise period, and continuously during the 10-min recovery period. Vascular conductance (VC) was calculated from the MBABF normalized by forearm volume and mean blood pressure (MBP). Results: Females achieved higher relative muscle force (%MVC) than males throughout both the exercise and the recovery periods (P < 0.05); females tended to exhibit smaller declines in muscle force (i.e., less fatigue). Exercise-induced increases in MBABF normalized to forearm volume were greater in females compared with males during the relaxation phases (P < 0.05), during which females also exhibited greater VC than males (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the normalized MBABF and VC in females, who experience less muscle fatigue, are greater during intermittent maximal voluntary handgrip exercise.",0
"A systematic review of the sleep, sleepiness, and performance implications of limited wake shift work schedules","Objectives The aim of this review was to identify which limited wake shift work schedules (LWSW) best promote sleep, alertness, and performance. LWSW are fixed work/rest cycles where the time-at-work does is <= 8 hours and there is >1 rest period per day, on average, for >= 2 consecutive days. These schedules are commonly used in safety-critical industries such as transport and maritime industries.Methods Literature was sourced using PubMed, Embase, PsycTnfo, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. We identified 20 independent studies (plus a further 2 overlapping studies), including 5 laboratory and 17 field-based studies focused on maritime watch keepers, ship bridge officers, and long-haul train drivers. The measurement of outcome measures was varied, incorporating subjective and objective measures of sleep: sleep diaries (N=5), actigraphy (N=4), and polysomnography, (N=3); sleepiness: Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (N=5), visual analog scale (VAS) alertness (N=2) and author-derived measures (N=2); and performance: Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) (N=5), Reaction Time or Vigilance tasks (N=4), Vector and Letter Cancellation Test (N=1), and subjective performance (N=2).Results Of the three primary rosters examined (6 hours-on/6 hours-off, 8 hours-on/8 hours-off and 4 hours-on/8 hours-off), the 4 hours-on/8 hours-off roster was associated with better sleep and lower levels of sleepiness. Individuals working 4 hours-on/8 hours-off rosters averaged 1 hour more sleep per night than those working 6 hours-on/6 hours-off and 1.3 hours more sleep than those working 8 hours-on/8 hours-off (P<0.01). More broadly, findings indicate that LWSW schedules were associated with better sleep and lower sleepines in the case of (i) shorter time-at-work, (ii) more frequent rest breaks, (iii) shifts that start and end at the same clock time every 24 hours, and (iv) work shifts commencing in the daytime (as opposed to night). The findings for performance remain incomplete due to the small number of studies containing a performance measure and the heterogeneity of performance measures within those that did.Conclusion The literature supports the utility of LWSW in industries where individuals sleep at or near the workplace as they facilitate at least some sleep during the biological night and minimize deficits associated with time-on-shift with shorter shifts. Overall, the 4 hour-on/8 hour-off roster best promoted sleep and minimized sleepiness compared to other LWSW schedules. Nevertheless, and considering the safety-critical nature of industries which employ LWSW, the limited literature needs to be greatly expanded with specific focus on the consequences for performance and comparison to mainstream rosters.",0
Objective measurement of vocal fatigue in classical singers: A vocal dosimetry pilot study,"OBJECTIVES: To collect objective vibration dose data on singers and relate them to subjective measurements of vocal fatigue.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Seven subjects completed a 2-week study period. The National Center for Voice and Speech (NCVS) dosimeter recorded vocal load, soft phonation tasks, and subjective soft voice ratings. Three vocal doses (time, distance, and cycle) were measured in classical singers' larynges during an intensive practice period.RESULTS: Spikes in vocal load are reflected as harsher subjective ratings on the same day as well as 24-72 hours later. When at least 48 hours of vocal rest occurred before a vocal load, improved subjective evaluations were seen after the load.CONCLUSIONS: The NCVS dosimeter appears to be an effective tool for data collection on prolonged use of the voice.SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first multi-day study comparing objective and subjective data on vocal fatigue in a group of professional singers.

Excessive daytime sleepiness. An epidemiological study based on a sleep/breathing questionnaire,"Background. - A field survey used a sleep-breathing questionnaire to estimate the prevalence of the excessive daytime sleepiness in a sample of middle-aged males.Methods. - Eight hundred and fifty men aged 22 to 66 years agreed to answer a questionnaire and have anthropometric measurements. To the question on excessive daytime sleepiness, 90 subjects (10.8%) responded often or almost always; 740 gave a negative answer.Results. - The sleepy subjects were older and had a higher central weight. All the sleep-disturbed breathing symptoms and those suggesting sleep disturbances were more frequent in sleepy subjects. Sleepiness was significantly associated with sleep apnea and chronic bronchitis. Logistic regression identified six items independently associated with daytime sleepiness; there were three indirect indicators of sleepiness, age, a history of chronic bronchitis and disruptive movements during sleep.Conclusions. - This epidemiologic study in a sample of active middle-aged males confirms the association of daytime sleepiness with a series of respiratory and non-respiratory sleep disturbances. The original findings are the role of a central obesity, the association with nightmares, and the role of chronic bronchitis as a determinant of daytime sleepiness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Optimal Navigation in Microfluidics via the Optimization of a Discrete Loss,"Optimal path planning and control of microscopic devices navigating in fluid environments is essential for applications ranging from targeted drug delivery to environmental monitoring. These tasks are challenging due to the complexity of microdevice-flow interactions. We introduce a closed-loop control method that optimizes a discrete loss (ODIL) in terms of dynamics and path objectives. In comparison with reinforcement learning, ODIL is more robust, up to 3 orders faster, and excels in high-dimensional action and state spaces, making it a powerful tool for navigating complex flow environments.",0
FULL SCALE EXPERIMENTAL DATABASE OF DENT AND GOUGE DEFECTS TO IMPROVE BURST AND FATIGUE STRENGTH MODELS OF PIPELINES,"External interference on gas and oil transmission pipelines is consistently reported as leading cause of leaks in Europe and USA as identified in the EGIG and PHMSA incident databases. External interference due to ground working machinery strikes, rock strikes during backfilling, etc. on buried pipelines result mainly in dent and gouge defects. The long-term integrity of a pipeline segment damaged by a dent and gouge defect is a complex function of a variety of parameters, including pipe material properties, pipe geometry, defect geometry linked to indenter shape, aggression conditions.The complexity and extreme variability of these dent and gouge defect shapes and pipe materials lead simple assessment models to scattered predictions, hinting towards an insufficient description of real structural and material behavior. To improve knowledge beyond the numerous studies led in the past, and to provide a sound foundation for developing and validating mechanistic models for predicting burst and fatigue strength of such defects, a large experimental program was funded by PRCI and US DoT and further coordinated with a complementary EPRG program.The experimental program part dealing with combined Dent and Gouge defects is covered for modern pipes (24 OD, X52 and X70) by PRCI project MD-4-1: realistically created (with a Pipe Aggression Rig) defects submitted to full scale burst and fatigue tests, in addition to extensive characterization.

Telehealth-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy - a potential solution to improve sleep quality and normalize the salience network in fibromyalgia: a pilot randomized trial,"Our study investigated the associations between the clinical benefits of telehealth-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (tele-CBT-I) and the salience network in fibromyalgia (FM). Thirty-five FM patients with comorbid insomnia were recruited and assigned into two groups: the tele-CBT-I group (n = 17) or the treatment-as-usual (TAU) group (n = 18). At baseline and post-treatment, clinical status was assessed using standardized scales, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Brief Pain Inventory, Numeric Pain Rating scale, Beck Depression Intervention version II, Beck Anxiety Intervention, Situational Fatigue Scale, and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaires. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected. We compared within- and between-group differences in clinical changes and functional connectivity (FC) of the salience network. A factor analysis of significant FCs was performed. Correlation analyses between clinical symptoms and salience FCs were conducted. The tele-CBT-I group showed sleep quality improvements after treatment that were greater than those in the TAU group (p-value = 0.038). After treatment, tele-CBT-I decreased FCs of cortical regions and increased FCs of subcortical regions compared to the TAU group. Additionally, factor analysis grouped the significant FCs into cortical factors and subcortical factors. The cortical factor value, representing the involvement of specific cortical regions of the salience network by the factor analysis, was significantly associated with ISI scores in the tele-CBT-I group (p-value = 0.0002). In conclusion, tele-CBT-I might be an adjuvant approach to improve sleep quality and normalize cortical and subcortical functions of the salience network in FM patients with comorbid insomnia.",0
A mindfulness group intervention in newly diagnosed persons with multiple sclerosis: A pilot study,"Background: Relapsing MS (RMS) is a lifelong disease without a cure, usually diagnosed between 20-40 years of age. Being newly diagnosed with RMS is a highly stressful event due to the unpredictable disease course after diagnosis. Thus, it is imperative that persons with MS have the skills and support to cope with the negative physical and emotional effects of the disease. The objective of this study was to assess whether a mindfulnessbased intervention (MBI) would improve coping skills and thus lessen the negative consequences of stress due to being newly diagnosed with RMS. Methods: This was a single-blind (assessor), randomized, prospective study of a 10-week MBI vs. usual standard of care in persons newly diagnosed (within 1 year) with RMS, recruited from one tertiary care MS clinic in London (ON), Canada. The MBI was administered in group format with a trained MBI facilitator. Primary outcomes included the Brief COPE measure and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) subscales. Secondary outcomes included measures of perceived stress, cognitive function, fatigue, and quality of life. Exploratory (tertiary) outcomes included serum markers of inflammation and stress. Subjects were assessed at baseline, post intervention (or equivalent) and 6 months later. A repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used, with baseline scores employed as covariates and the test scores, to compare longitudinal changes, immediately after the MBI sessions and 6 months later. Results: Twenty-five subjects were recruited (16 MBI, 9 controls) for two (Fall and Spring) MBI interventions over 1.5 years. All controls completed the study, while 4 MBI participants did not, leaving 21 subjects in the analysis. Most were women (17, 81%), with a mean age of 37.1 +/- 9.4 years. Two thirds had already started a DMT at the time of consent; the median EDSS was 2.0 (0.0-4.0). The groups were well matched on baseline characteristics, with the exception of months since diagnosis (MBI 6.4 +/- 6.5 vs. control 3.6 +/- 2.8, p=0.023). All controls completed the study, while 4 MBI participants did not. The MBI group improved significantly on the COPE measure when compared to the control group (p=0.024) pre and post intervention; the MBI group also improved significantly on the HADS depression subscale (p=0.007). There was no significant difference over time on the HADS anxiety subscale (p=0.179). The effect size on COPE was 0.56 and 0.40 on HADS-D. On the secondary outcomes, there was a significant improvement on the Perceived Stress Scale (p=0.015). The exploratory outcomes were not significantly different. None of the outcomes were significant at the six-month follow-up. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrates that an MBI may improve coping, depression and perceived stress in newly diagnosed (within one year) persons with RMS in the short term. Future research to confirm these results, as well as further investigate measures to extend the benefit beyond the immediate intervention.",0
Modifications of the National Early Warning Score for patients with chronic respiratory disease,"BackgroundThe National Early Warning Score (NEWS) uses physiological variables to detect deterioration in hospitalized patients. However, patients with chronic respiratory disease may have abnormal variables not requiring interventions. We studied how the Capital Region of Denmark NEWS Override System (CROS), the Chronic Respiratory Early Warning Score (CREWS) and the Salford NEWS (S-NEWS) affected NEWS total scores and NEWS performance.MethodsIn an observational study, we included patients with chronic respiratory disease. The frequency of use of CROS and the NEWS total score changes caused by CROS, CREWS and S-NEWS were described. NEWS, CROS, CREWS and S-NEWS were compared using 48-h mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 48h as outcomes.ResultsWe studied 11,266 patients during 25,978 admissions; the use of CROS lowered NEWS total scores in 40% of included patients. CROS, CREWS and S-NEWS had lower sensitivities than NEWS for 48-h mortality and ICU admission. Specificities and PPV were higher. CROS, CREWS and S-NEWS downgraded, respectively, 51.5%, 44.9% and 32.8% of the NEWS total scores from the mandatory doctor presence' and immediate doctor presence and specialist consultation' total score intervals to lower intervals.ConclusionCapital Region of Denmark NEWS Override System was frequently used in patients with chronic respiratory disease. CROS, CREWS and S-NEWS reduced sensitivity for 48-h mortality and ICU admission. Using the methodology prevalent in the NEWS literature, we cannot conclude on the safety of these systems. Future prospective studies should investigate the balance between detection rate and alarm fatigue of different systems, or use controlled designs and patient-centred outcomes.",0
A Multi-Model Analysis for Driving Fatigue Detection using EEG Signals,"Electroencephalographic (EEG) technology's noninvasive, inexpensive, and potable qualities have recently increased interest in EEG-based driving fatigue detection. EEG signals have been one of the most accurate and reliable markers of driver fatigue. Despite this, extracting valuable features from cluttered EEG signals still difficult to detect driving fatigue. This study aims to create a novel real-time methodology for detecting driving fatigue based on EEG signals. The study utilizes the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to obtain different EEG bands and compute power spectrum density (PSD) and other statistical features over each DWT band for the online detection of mental fatigue. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), has demonstrated impressive results in recent years as a method to extract features from EEG signals among various analysis techniques successfully. Although automatic feature extraction and accurate classification are advantages of deep learning, designing the network structure can be challenging and requires a vast amount of prior knowledge. Therefore, we used these features as input to CNN instead of using raw EEG data directly. Classification results of multiple machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), k- nearest neighbor (kNN), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Decision Tree (DT), and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers are also explored to obtain an optimum solution of the driver's fatigue evaluation. Two driving fatigue EEG datasets were used as testbeds to denote the effectiveness of five conventional classifiers and CNN. The proposed method reached more than 99% classification accuracy using a kNN and CNN in both datasets. The outcomes confirmed the efficacy of the suggested approach.",1
Comparison of activities of daily living in two different one arm drive wheelchairs: a controlled trial.,"AIMS: This pilot study measured activities of daily living (ADLs) in users propelling both a standard dual handrim Action 3 wheelchair and a standard Action 3 wheelchair with a Neater Uni-Wheelchair (NUW) kit attachment. The kit consists of a steerable front castor and a single pushrim propelling both rear wheels via a differential.HYPOTHESIS: There would be a difference in the efficiency of ADL skill performance, speed and heart rate.METHODS: Twenty non-disabled participants simulating hemiplegia were used in a cross over, repeated measures trial. Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) of users undertaking making a bed and laying a table 'Swedish style', tasks, were measured. Heart rate at rest and post-task and time taken to complete each task were recorded.RESULTS: Heart rate when laying the table was lower in the NUW (p < 0.005) and task completion time was quicker (p < 0.0001). There was no difference in motor and process ability skills.CONCLUSION: ADL tasks in the NUW were completed more efficiently with no loss in quality of motor and process skills performance. This suggests that the NUW is a viable alternative to current one arm drive provision.",0
Monitoring Bond Wires Fatigue of Multichip IGBT Module Using Time Duration of the Gate Charge,"Monitoring the defective multichip insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module is a cost-effective approach to improve the quality of customer service. A method using time duration of the gate charge is proposed to monitor bond wires fatigue of the multichip IGBT modules when the modules are in the off-state. It is based on the fact that failure of the chip branch due to bond wires fatigue changes the gate input capacitance of the multichip IGBT module. The health state of bond wires can be converted into the change of time duration of gate charge under the constant gate current. A driver containing the constant current source is proposed. The study results indicate that the time duration of the gate charge decreases significantly when the failure of the chip branch occurs, and the effect of junction temperature can be ignored within the special range of gate voltage. Condition monitoring can be implemented during the off-state of the multichip module and without considering the effects of junction temperature. The confirmatory experiment is carried out to verify the correctness of the proposed method.",0
Sexual dysfunctions after traumatic brain injury: Systematic review of the literature,"Background. - Sexual dysfunction (SD) is common in the general population, up to 50% in women and with no clearly defined prevalence in men but up to 30% in erectile dysfunction. Sexual dysfunctions (SD) are common after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) but remain underrated in clinical practice, yet it is a crucial aspect of the person with consequences for the relationship with the other, psychological wellbeing and quality of life.Objective. - To determine, through a systematic literature review, the epidemiology, assessment tools and treatment of SD in the TBI population.Sources. - (keywords, languages): Medline, COCHRANE and OVID databases were used with specific keywords (MeSH), combined with Boolean operators: sexual dysfunction, sexuality, erectile dysfunction and traumatic brain injury.Study selection. - Only studies published in French or English, and with full-text available, have been included. Articles have been independently reviewed and extracted.Results. - Of the 199 articles reviewed after exclusion of duplicates, 86 articles were reviewed in their full text. A total of 40 studies were included in the final analysis. After TBI, 6% to 83% of patients report SD: decreased frequency of sexual intercourse (47-62%), desire and/or arousal (24-86%), erectile dysfunction (24,2-57%), difficulties with orgasm (29-40%), inappropriate sexual behaviour (8,9%). There is no consensus method for evaluating SD in this population, with 16 tools identified. Among them, only two questionnaires were validated in this population, the Brain Injury Questionnary of Sexuality - not validated in French - and the Overt Behavior Scale, the latter being intended for the evaluation of sexual behaviour disorders. Several factors are significantly and positively associated with SD: age (P <= 0.01), severity of TBI (P <= 0.002), depression (P< 0.001), anxiety (P< 0.001), and fatigue (P=0.042). Others are negatively associated: time since injury (P=0.01), perceived physical health status (P< 0.001) and social participation (P< 0.001). There is little data on the treatment of SD outside of case studies.Limits. - Quantitative analysis could not be performed due to differences in the studies included in their design, evaluation tools, choice of TBI severity criteria, and post-TBI timeframes. Four unavailable articles could not be consulted.Conclusion. - SD are common after TBI but remain poorly evaluated in clinical practice, despite their impact on patients and their partners. Their evaluation and treatment should be part of the overall management of patients after TBI. Nevertheless, there is currently no validated tool in French to evaluate these SD, nor are there any guidelines on their treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",0
Gold Standard Generation Using Electrooculogram Signal for Drowsiness Detection in Simulator Conditions,The aim of this work is to generate a Gold Standard signal to assess the alertness state of drivers based on the Electrooculogram (EOG) dynamics derived from a polysomnography device. Different EOG patterns have been analyzed in order to determine the relation between ocular activity and sleep onset while doing complex tasks. More than 15 h of laboratory tests were analyzed in order to detect drowsiness while doing different cognitive activities. The proposed method has a sensitivity of 92.41 % and a Predictive Positive Value (VPP) of 93.41 % in detecting drowsiness in laboratory conditions. The results show that the proposed index may be promising to assess the alertness state of real drivers.,1
Addressing post-COVID-19 musculoskeletal symptoms through pulmonary rehabilitation with an evidence-based eHealth education tool: Preliminary results from a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial,"Background:The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a global health crisis with significant long-term consequences, including musculoskeletal symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, and chronic pain. These issues, often linked to altered nociceptive processing, impair quality of life and are exacerbated in severe cases by intensive care unit-acquired weakness from immobilization and mechanical ventilation. Early rehabilitation, particularly pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), is crucial for mitigating these effects. Telerehabilitation, leveraging telemedicine, offers an innovative, accessible alternative, providing personalized programs that improve adherence and recovery. Recent studies highlight telerehabilitation's benefits alongside traditional methods, underscoring its potential for managing post-COVID-19 musculoskeletal sequelae. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of PR and an eHealth education tool (ET) on pain, functionality, quality of life, and psychological factors in post-COVID-19 patients with musculoskeletal symptoms and to compare telerehabilitation versus face-to-face approaches regarding treatment adherence. Methods:This pilot randomized controlled trial included 12 patients with musculoskeletal symptoms of COVID-19. The participants were randomly assigned to a PR program with or without an evidence-based eHealth ET. Primary outcomes included pain reduction and improvements in functional capacity, quality of life, and psychological factors measured over a 45-week period. The secondary outcome was adherence to rehabilitation. Results:A significant reduction in kinesiophobia was found in the eHealth ET group (P = .048), although no significant differences were observed in pain, Barthel index, or 6-minute walk test results between the groups. Clinically relevant improvements were observed in the telemedicine group. Conclusions:An evidence-based eHealth ET was effective in reducing kinesiophobia, highlighting its potential to address psychological aspects of post-COVID-19 recovery. However, further studies are needed to assess its long-term effects on physical recovery.",0
Psychometric Assessment of Anxiety Measures in a Pilot Study of African American Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"African American patient populations are disproportionately diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) compared to non-Hispanic white adults. Research suggests a link between OSA and anxiety. However, OSA and anxiety symptoms may present differently across minority groups. Research examining the reliability and validity of measures used to assess anxiety symptom severity in African American patient populations living with OSA is needed. This pilot study evaluated the reliability and validity of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety short form and the longer State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State (STAI-S) in a sample of African American adults recently diagnosed with OSA. In this cross-sectional pilot study, 32 African American patients newly diagnosed with OSA were recruited from an academic sleep medicine clinic in the Southeastern United States to complete survey measures. Participants completed the 6-item PROMIS Anxiety short form and 20-item STAI-S. Cronbach's alphas assessed the internal reliability of measures, and concurrent validity between measures was assessed using correlation coefficients (r(s)). Both PROMIS Anxiety and STAI-S showed excellent internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha >=.90. The PROMIS Anxiety T-scores and STAI-S scores were positively moderately correlated with each other (r(s) = .68; p < .0001), indicating concurrent validity. These results illustrate that both the PROMIS Anxiety and STAI-S scales have strong internal reliability in this sample of African American adults with co-occurring OSA and prediabetes. The brief PROMIS Anxiety short-form measure is validated to the longer STAI measure in this sample. An advantage of the PROMIS Anxiety scale is that it has a lower participant burden when completing questionnaires, contributing to a more refined approach to diagnosis and management when both OSA and anxiety coexist. These findings also underscore the importance of validating psychometric measures in marginalized populations, such as African Americans, who have historically been underrepresented in psychometric research.",0
"The effects of cognitive distraction on behavioural, oculomotor and electrophysiological metrics during a driving hazard perception task","Previous research has demonstrated that the distraction caused by holding a mobile telephone conversation is not limited to the period of the actual conversation (Haigney, 1995; Redelmeier & Tibshirani, 1997; Savage a al., 2013). In a prior study we identified potential eye movement and EEG markers of cognitive distraction during driving hazard perception. However the extent to which these markers are affected by the demands of the hazard perception task are unclear. Therefore in the current study we assessed the effects of secondary cognitive task demand on eye movement and EEG metrics separately for periods prior to, during and after the hazard was visible. We found that when no hazard was present (prior and post hazard windows), distraction resulted in changes to various elements of saccadic eye movements. However, when the target was present, distraction did not affect eye movements.We have previously found evidence that distraction resulted in an overall decrease in theta band output at occipital sites of the brain. This was interpreted as evidence that distraction results in a reduction in visual processing. The current study confirmed this by examining the effects of distraction on the lambda response component of subjects eye fixation related potentials (EFRPs). Furthermore, we demonstrated that although detections of hazards were not affected by distraction, both eye movement and EEG metrics prior to the onset of the hazard were sensitive to changes in cognitive workload. This suggests that changes to specific aspects of the saccadic eye movement system could act as unobtrusive markers of distraction even prior to a breakdown in driving performance.",0
"Physical Activity, Sleep, and BMI Percentile in Rural and Urban Ugandan Youth","BACKGROUND Uganda is experiencing a dual burden of over-and undernutrition, with overweight prevalence increasing while underweight remains common. Potential weight-related factors, particularly physical activity, sleep, and rural/urban status, are not currently well understood or commonly assessed in Ugandan youth.OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to pilot test a survey measuring weight- related factors in rural and urban Ugandan schoolchildren. METHODS A cross-sectional survey measured sociodemographics, physical activity, sleep patterns, and dietary factors in 148 rural and urban schoolchildren aged 11-16 in central Uganda. Height and weight were objectively measured. Rural and urban youth were compared on these factors using chi 2 and t tests. Regression was used to identify correlates of higher body mass index (BMI) percentile in the full sample and nonstunted youth.FINDINGS Youth were on average 12.1 +/- 1.1 years old; underweight (10%) was more common than overweight (1.4%). Self-reported sleep duration and subjective sleep quality did not differ by rural/urban residence. Rural children overall had higher BMI percentile and marginally higher stunting prevalence. In adjusted analyses in both the full and nonstunted samples, higher BMI percentile was related to living in a rural area, higher frequency of physical activity, and higher subjective sleep quality; it was negatively related to being active on weekends. In the full sample, higher BMI percentile was also related to female gender, whereas in nonstunted youth, higher BMI was related to age. BMI percentile was unrelated to sedentary time, performance of active chores and sports, and dietary factors.CONCLUSIONS This study is one of the first to pilot test a survey assessing weight- related factors, particularly physical activity and sleep, in Ugandan schoolchildren. BMI percentile was related to several sociodemographic, sleep, and physical activity factors among primarily normal-weight school children in Uganda, providing a basis for understanding weight status in the context of the nutrition transition.",0
A lightweight approach for human factor assessment in virtual assembly designs: an evaluation model for postural risk and metabolic workload,"The assessment and optimisation of postural stress and physical fatigue can be challenging and is typically conducted only after the design of manual operations has been finalised. However early assessment of manual operations and identification of critical factors that are deemed outside of an appropriate envelope can avoid the time and costs often associated with re-designing machines and layout for operator work processes. This research presents a low cost software solution based on a simplified skeleton model that uses operator position and workload data extracted from a simulation model used for virtual manufacturing process planning. The developed approach aims to assess postural stress and physical fatigue scores of assembly operations, as they are being designed and simulated virtually. The model is based on the Automotive Assembly Worksheet and the Garg's metabolic rate prediction model. The proposed research focuses on the integration of virtual process planning, ergonomic and metabolic analysis tools, and on automating human factor assessment to enable optimisation of assembly operations and workload capabilities at early design stage.

Looking at Faces in a Vehicle: A Deep CNN Based Approach and Evaluation,"The driver's face is key to a less intrusive method to monitoring the driver to derive information such as distraction, drowsiness, intent, and where they are looking. A vital step in extracting these higher level information is to find the driver's face and individual components such as eyes, nose and mouth, along with the direction they are facing towards. In the context of safety critical situation like driving, it is important that this vital step be robust otherwise the higher level information is not available or unreliable. The lighting condition of a driver's cabin varies greatly from dark due to driving under a bridge or in a parking structure to extremely bright on a sunny day. Various occlusions on the face may also occur due to hand activities such as drinking water or different gestures. This work introduces a system based on existing CNN structures with slight modifications to implement face detection, landmark localization, and landmark-based head pose estimation method which addresses the challenges found in the driver cabin. To handle these challenges, training samples are artificially augmented for the purpose of developing a system robust in the environment of a vehicle.",0
PROBABILISTIC FLAW GROWTH RATE ESTIMATES USING MULTIPLE INLINE INSPECTION TOOL RUN DATA ANALYSES,"Many pipeline operators perform run comparisons (or run-coms) during assessment of their inline inspection data. Analysts match corrosion pit depths reported in back-to-back tool runs and estimate corrosion growth rates, remaining lives, and appropriate reinspection intervals. This approach is generally deemed more accurate than using an assumed constant growth rate for all reported features. However, the accuracy of each estimate is subject to the depth sizing error inherent in the measurements. The larger a dataset, the higher the likelihood of many calculated corrosion growth rates being misleading. This is due to there being a higher likelihood of extreme depth sizing errors. A first run undercall followed by a second run overcall compounds the depth sizing error and may result in an overly conservative decision. A first run overcall followed by a second run undercall and may result in a missed defect. Both scenarios can lead to a misuse of resources.This work is a statistical analysis of flaw growth that considers and accommodates for depth sizing errors. The result is that the growth rate for each ILI reported flaw is considered probabilistically. Advanced data ingestion algorithms allow analysts to align multiple ILI tool run data sets quickly and conveniently, opening the door to advanced data analytics, including work with non-linear flaw growth rates. This work looks at corrosion and SCC growth rates (approximated as linear) and fatigue crack growth rates that follow established Paris Law behavior (non-linear).",0
"Acceptance of physical activity monitoring in cancer patients during radiotherapy, the GIROfit phase 2 pilot trial.","Background: In radiotherapy the timely identification of patients needing intervention and supportive care due to side effects is an important task especially in the outpatient setting. Activity trackers as an increasingly used lifestyle device may enable physicians to monitor patient's physical activity (PA) and to intervene early during the course of radiotherapy.Objective: The primary aim of this trial was to assess patient acceptance of PA monitoring in an outpatient setting and to correlate changes in PA with toxicity and changes in quality of life.Methods: Patients undergoing radio(chemo-)therapy with a curative intent were eligible to participate in this prospective pilot phase II trial. Patients were instructed to wear a commercially available activity tracker during the course of radiotherapy and four weeks afterwards. Quality of life (QoL) and fatigue was scored using the Functional assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy questionnaire. A linear regression was performed to determine baseline activity and changes in step counts during radiotherapy.Results: We included 23 patients in this trial. Two withdrew consent before the start of treatment, two patients were excluded after prophylactic feeding tube placement and prolonged recovery. Compliance in the remaining 19 patients was high, with availability of step-counts on 92% of the days. Baseline step counts were 6274 for breast cancer patients and 3621 for patients with other entities. Decreasing activity during radiotherapy coincided with the development of side effects and declines in quality of life.Conclusions: Activity trackers as tool to monitor PA during and after radiotherapy were accepted by a majority of the patients included in the current trial. Observed changes in PA correlated with patient reported side effects and QoL in some of the patients.",0
Pilot Test of NIOSH Training for Law Enforcement on Shift Work and Long Work Hours,"Objective Pilot test the effectiveness of an online training program for managing shift work and long work hours. Method Fifty-seven officers from across the United States participated for 12 weeks in a pre-test, training intervention, post-test design assessing the following measures: sleep using actigraphy, diaries, and surveys; knowledge and feedback about the training using surveys. Results After the training, actigraphy data showed significant reductions in sleep latency and awakenings during sleep. Survey data showed reductions in sleepiness, difficulty staying awake during the day, and difficulty getting things done. Frequency of nightmares also decreased. Participant's knowledge about sleep improved and satisfaction with the training was high. Conclusion Participants were satisfied with the training and showed objective improvements in their sleep and subjective improvements in feelings when awake. This research will help inform interventions to improve police officer health and wellness.",0
Self-Supervised Multi-Granularity Graph Attention Network for Vision-Based Driver Fatigue Detection,"Driver fatigue is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. Current vision-based methods for detecting driver fatigue lack robustness in the presence of interfering images, and exhibit insufficient ability to focus on frames containing crucial information. To address these issues, we propose a Self-supervised Multi-granularity Graph Attention Network (SMGA-Net) for driver fatigue detection. The network mainly contains the following contributions: Firstly, with the multi-task self-supervised learning strategy, a novel method called Image Restoration based Self-supervised Learning (IRS-Learning) is proposed to enhance the network's robustness when processing interfering images. Secondly, with the graph attention mechanism, a Multi-head Graph Attention (MG-Attention) module is designed to concentrate on frames that contain crucial information by assigning importance weights to each frame. In addition, a Cross Attention Feature Fusion (CAF-Fusion) method is proposed to adaptively merge the multi-granularity features and emphasize effective information contained therein. Experiments performed on the National TsingHua University Drowsy Driver Detection (NTHU-DDD) dataset show that the proposed SMGA-Net based driver fatigue detection method outperforms the state-of-art methods.",1
Integrated steering wheel system based on nanostructured elastomeric sensors for real time detection of driver drowsiness status,"Automotive sensors market has valued 19.7 USD billion in 2014 with an expectation of growth up to 30.0 billion in 2020 [1]. Among the different types of sensors for automotive, devices for safety applications result particularly important and appealing. In this scenario, elastomeric polymers represent a low cost, easy-to-use choice that results to be suitable for large-scale application. In this work, we propose a new sensing system based on the use of a smart steering wheel for the increase of driver's safeness. The wheel is able to detect the presence of the hands of the driver and reports the absence of contact thanks to high sensitive resistive pressure sensors based on elastomeric polymers distributed uniformly on the steering wheel and a specifically designed electronic control unit (ECU) connected to the CAN bus. All the components of the system are described and the performances of the whole prototype are reported, demonstrating high reliability.",1
The Effects of back lit Aircraft Instrument Displays on Pilots Fatigue and Performance,"One of the latest trends in the global aviation industry is to use smart technologies and interfaces as time saving and efficiency tools. Larger flight instrument displays have replaced conventional, analogue, instruments and can be combined with touch screen efficiency tools. Their ever-increasing size brings with them issues relating to light emissions and eye absorption. Especially emissions of certain colours of light at certain times affecting the Pilots circadian rhythms and cause eye fatigue - which is recognised to have an impact on Pilots performance. (Davies R., 2018)This research paper complements the current study and measurement of stress, fatigue and human factors with respect to increasing artificial light intensity experienced by Pilots on the Flight Deck. The authors present the results of several measurements taken using a flight simulator which meets the current regulations for Pilot training. However, the conditions have been adjusted to the realistic conditions of a Flight Deck. The research results provide Air Operators, Airlines and aeronautical designers with valuable data on human behaviour and the reactions to Flight Deck environmental changes.For the purpose of our research, we decided to use eye monitoring technology to record eye movements to determine the pilot's performance. Eye monitoring provides data on the number of eye movements, fixations and the durations of these. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",1
Developing an EEG-based on-line closed-loop lapse detection and mitigation system,"In America, 60% of adults reported that they have driven a motor vehicle while feeling drowsy, and at least 15-20% of fatal car accidents are fatigue-related. This study translates previous laboratory-oriented neurophysiological research to design, develop, and test an On-line Closed-loop Lapse Detection and Mitigation (OCLDM) System featuring a mobile wireless dry-sensor EEG headgear and a cell-phone based real-time EEG processing platform. Eleven subjects participated in an event-related lane-keeping task, in which they were instructed to manipulate a randomly deviated, fixed-speed cruising car on a 4-lane highway. This was simulated in a 1st person view with an 8-screen and 8-projector immersive virtual-reality environment. When the subjects experienced lapses or failed to respond to events during the experiment, auditory warning was delivered to rectify the performance decrements. However, the arousing auditory signals were not always effective. The EEG spectra exhibited statistically significant differences between effective and ineffective arousing signals, suggesting that EEG spectra could be used as a countermeasure of the efficacy of arousing signals. In this on-line pilot study, the proposed OCLDM System was able to continuously detect EEG signatures of fatigue, deliver arousing warning to subjects suffering momentary cognitive lapses, and assess the efficacy of the warning in near real-time to rectify cognitive lapses. The on-line testing results of the OCLDM System validated the efficacy of the arousing signals in improving subjects' response times to the subsequent lane-departure events. This study may lead to a practical on-line lapse detection and mitigation system in real-world environments.",1
Crack defect formation during manufacture of fused cast alumina refractories,"A sequentially coupled mathematical thermal-stress model, based on the commercial finite-element code ABAQUS, has been developed to rationalize crack defect formation in fused cast alphabeta-alumina refractories used in the glass industry. The thermal model was validated against thermocouple and pyrometer measurements obtained in an industrial setting. The temperature predictions obtained from the thermal model were employed as input to the elastic strain-rate-independent plastic stress model. The constitutive behavior of alphabeta-alumina has been determined over a range of temperatures for input to the stress model. The distribution of beta-alumina that forms in the center of the casting due to rejection of Na2O during solidification was introduced in the stress model through a user-defined subroutine in order to account for the effect of differences in the thermal contraction behavior and elastic modulus of the alphabeta- and beta-alumina phases. The stress analysis indicates that temperature gradients as well as the different dilatational behavior of the alphabeta- and beta-alumina phases are the main drivers of stress and strain evolution during solidification and subsequent cooling. The beta-alumina core, in particular, plays an important role in the generation of tensile stresses and likely gives rise to the generation of the internal cracks observed in industrial castings.",0
Enhanced ALIVE Mind Controller and Machine Learning to Detect Drowsiness While Driving,"Thousands of road accidents occur each year, one of the main causes being drowsiness at the wheel. Therefore, this paper proposes an enhanced scheme called ALIVE Mind to detect drowsy drivers and take action on their car using Machine Learning and EEG. For that matter, we built and designed a circuit board called AMC 2.0 that allows a simple EEG headset to read brain waves from a driver and send this data to a computer via Bluetooth. Those signals are then saved and analyzed by a deep neural network to find if the driver is drowsy or is about to sleep. To evaluate our solution, we conducted simulations and collected brain signals of a subject driver while on a driving simulator. With those values, we were able to train a model to detect whether the subject was drowsy or awake. Finally, when the system detects that the driver is in a fatigued state, it can take control of the car to park it in a safe place. Preliminary results show the effectiveness of the ALIVE Mind project and how it outperforms previous works in terms of minimizing computational needs and improving the prototype's convenience and suitability for car constructors.",1
Single-Channel EEG Based Arousal Level Estimation Using Multitaper Spectrum Estimation at Low-Power Wearable Devices,"This paper proposes a novel lightweight method using the multitaper power spectrum to estimate arousal levels at wearable devices. We show that the spectral slope (1/f) of the electrophysiological power spectrum reflects the scale-free neural activity. To evaluate the proposed feature's performance, we used scalp EEG recorded during anesthesia and sleep with technician-scored Hypnogram annotations. It is shown that the proposed methodology discriminates wakefulness from reduced arousal solely based on the neurophysiological brain state with more than 80% accuracy. Therefore, our findings describe a common electrophysiological marker that tracks reduced arousal states, which can be applied to different applications (e.g., emotion detection, driver drowsiness). Evaluation on hardware shows that the proposed methodology can be implemented for devices with a minimum RAM of 512 KB with 55 mJ average energy consumption.",1
Questions and Controversies in the Clinical Application of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors to Treat Patients with Radioiodine-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma: Expert Perspectives,"Notwithstanding regulatory approval of lenvatinib and sorafenib to treat radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (RAI-R DTC), important questions and controversies persist regarding this use of these tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). RAI-R DTC experts from German tertiary referral centers convened to identify and explore such issues; this paper summarizes their discussions. One challenge is determining when to start TKI therapy. Decision-making should be shared between patients and multidisciplinary caregivers, and should consider tumor size/burden, growth rate, and site(s), the key drivers of RAI-R DTC morbidity and mortality, along with current and projected tumor-related symptomatology, co-morbidities, and performance status. Another question involves choice of first-line TKIs. Currently, lenvatinib is generally preferred, due to greater increase in progression-free survival versus placebo treatment and higher response rate in its pivotal trial versus that of sorafenib; additionally, in those studies, lenvatinib but not sorafenib showed overall survival benefit in subgroup analysis. Whether recommended maximum or lower TKI starting doses better balance anti-tumor effects versus tolerability is also unresolved. Exploratory analyses of lenvatinib pivotal study data suggest dose-response effects, possibly favoring higher dosing; however, results are awaited of a prospective comparison of lenvatinib starting regimens. Some controversy surrounds determination of net therapeutic benefit, the key criterion for continuing TKI therapy: if tolerability is acceptable, overall disease control may justify further treatment despite limited but manageable progression. Future research should assess potential guideposts for starting TKIs; fine-tune dosing strategies and further characterize antitumor efficacy; and evaluate interventions to prevent and/or treat TKI toxicity, particularly palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and fatigue.",0
Driver identification and fatigue detection algorithm based on deep learning,"In order to avoid traffic accidents caused by driver fatigue, smoking and talking on the phone, it is necessary to design an effective fatigue detection algorithm. Firstly, this paper studies the detection algorithms of driver fatigue at home and abroad, and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of the existing algorithms. Secondly, a face recognition module is introduced to crop and align the acquired faces and input them into the Facenet network model for feature extraction, thus completing the identification of drivers. Thirdly, a new driver fatigue detection algorithm based on deep learning is designed based on Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm, and the additional layer network structure of SSD is redesigned by using the idea of reverse residual. By adding the detection of drivers' smoking and making phone calls, adjusting the size and number of prior boxes of SSD algorithm, improving FPN network and SE network, the identification and verification of drivers can be realized. The experimental results showed that the number of parameters decreased from 96.62 MB to 18.24 MB. The average accuracy rate increased from 89.88% to 95.69%. The projected number of frames per second increased from 51.69 to 71.86. When the confidence threshold was set to 0.5, the recall rate of closed eyes increased from 46.69% to 65.87%, that of yawning increased from 59.72% to 82.72%, and that of smoking increased from 65.87% to 83.09%. These results show that the improved network model has better feature extraction ability for small targets.",1
Reigniting Intensive Care Unit Liberation,"BACKGROUND The Society of Critical Care Medicine has established guidelines to manage pain, sedation, delirium, immobility, family participation, and sleep disruption in the intensive care unit, a set of interventions known as the intensive care unit liberation (ABCDEF) bundle. Adherence to these guidelines has shown positive results. LOCAL PROBLEM In the intensive care units of a level I trauma academic teaching hospital in central Texas, the rate of bedside nursing staff adherence to the ABCDEF bundle was only 67.1% in January 2022. The aim of this quality improvement project was to improve adherence to the bundle. METHODS Knowledge gaps were found to be the driver of the low adherence rate. Two primary needs were identified: (1) education on the elements of the ABCDEF bundle and (2) increased awareness and recognition of incomplete and incorrect documentation. Interventions included focused education on RESULTS From February to June 2022, overall adherence to the ABCDEF bundle increased from 67.1% to 95.3%, ventilator use decreased by approximately 10%, and restraint use dropped by about 9%. The incidence of delirium increased, but this increase was due to incorrect patient assessment before the interventions. CONCLUSION The results of this project are consistent with literature demonstrating that a multifaceted approach to improving ABCDEF bundle adherence can produce sustainable improvement in patient outcomes. This report may help other organizations facing similar challenges improve adherence to the bundle in a postpandemic environment. (Critical Care Nurse. 2024;44[4]:19-26)",0
Using Cool Stimulation as a Strategy to Keep High Vigilance Level of High-Speed Railway Driver,"Decline of driver vigilance is a critical factor in fatal railway accidents. To prevent accidents induced by driver vigilance decline, intervention strategies are needed. The aim of this study is to investigate if cool stimulation intervention (CS-intervention) can be used as a countermeasure for the vigilance decline of high-speed railway (HSR) driver. The CS-intervention strategy was tested in an HSR driving simulator with 40 healthy participants with vigilance decline. Each participant completed two monotonous driving tasks: one without stimulation intervention (NO-intervention) and one with 20 degrees C CS-intervention. Self-reported vigilance was assessed by using the Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS), and the reaction time (RT) was used to estimate the objective vigilance. Eye-movement data, electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were collected to investigate the potential arousing effects of CS-intervention. The CS-intervention can effectively awake drivers to reduce their RTs and KSS. The driver's percentage of eye closure (PERCLOS) decreased while driving with CS-intervention. The high-frequency part of EEG signals is active, while the permutation entropy (PE) value in the frontal lobe is attenuated. The connectivity between brain lobes is enhanced. The physiological responses also prove the effectiveness of CS-intervention. This study indicates that CS-intervention is an effective strategy to alleviate fatigue and maintain vigilance. Given that CS-intervention can effectively counteract vigilance decline, the findings in this study are expected to provide evidence for the improvement of HSR driving safety.",1
Recreational Exercise in Rheumatic Diseases,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in health-related quality of life after eight to twelve months of recreational exercise in patients with rheumatic diseases (inflammatory joint disease, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia and other generalized pain syndromes), and to determine whether patient (age, sex, diagnosis) and exercise characteristics (follow-up time, type of activity, frequency of participation) are related to health-related quality of life change. Health-related quality of life was assessed twice in 138 patients with rheumatic diseases. 1) At enrolment in a centre for outpatient recreational exercise and 2) following eight to twelve months of recreational exercise. Health-related quality of life was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey 36 and three numeric rating scales for pain, fatigue and general condition. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the influence of patient and exercise characteristics on follow-up HRQoL-score. Patients showed significant improvements in pain and general condition, and reported a positive change in health. A diagnosis of inflammatory joint disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, polyarthritis, spondylitis) or osteoarthritis, participating in sports activities two to three times per week, and following land-based fitness classes Were associated with the most improvement in health-related quality of life. Regular participation in recreational exercise contributes to improved health-related quality of life in patients with rheumatic diseases.",0
Improved Psychological Health Through a Remote Behavioral Intervention: A Telehealth Pilot Study for Veterans with Chronic Multi-symptom Illness,"Cognitive control enables individuals to imagine future events and develop personal goals, which are critical for sense of purpose. For Veterans with chronic multi-symptom illness (CMI), augmenting cognitive control and other factors related to brain health may improve symptom management and quality of life (QoL). This pilot study utilizes neuroscience evidence to enhance psychological health, with a combination of remote meditation and aerobic exercise (mental and physical [MAP] training) to evaluate what type of distance-based instruction is optimal for Veterans engaged in these health behaviors. Twenty-five Veterans with CMI were randomized to either an eight-week directed MAP (dMAP; n = 12) group where specific instructions were provided via text messaging or an eight week self-guided MAP (sgMAP; n = 13) group where they received the goals of the MAP intervention without weekly guidance. Participants also completed health coaching weekly. Self-report health measures were collected during baseline, post-treatment, and three-month follow-up, with the primary outcome assessed using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version (BRIEF-A). A significant group-by-time interaction was observed for the BRIEF-A subscales: inhibit and task monitor, both demonstrating differences in the direction of change between the groups. A significant overall time effect was observed for depression, sleep quality, and mental health-related QoL, each demonstrating improvement. MAP training significantly improved multiple symptoms in Veterans with CMI. This suggests that empowering Veterans with goals and support through health coaching may be a viable approach to improving health in those suffering from chronic illness.",0
Quality of life and neutropenia in patients with early stage breast cancer: a randomized pilot study comparing additional treatment with mistletoe extract to chemotherapy alone.,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy for breast cancer often deteriorates quality of life, augments fatigue, and induces neutropenia. Mistletoe preparations are frequently used by cancer patients in Central Europe. Physicians have reported better quality of life in breast cancer patients additionally treated with mistletoe preparations during chemotherapy. Mistletoe preparations also have immunostimulant properties and might therefore have protective effects against chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized open label pilot study with 95 patients randomized into three groups. Two groups received Iscador M special (IMS) or a different mistletoe preparation, respectively, additionally to chemotherapy with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and 5-fluoro-uracil (CAF). A control group received CAF with no additional therapy. Here we report the comparison IMS (n = 30) vs. control (n = 31). Quality of life including fatigue was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30). Neutropenia was defined as neutrophil counts <1,000/mul and assessed at baseline and one day before each CAF cycle.RESULTS: In the descriptive analysis all 15 scores of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 showed better quality of life in the IMS group compared to the control group. In 12 scores the differences were significant (p < 0.02) and nine scores showed a clinically relevant and significant difference of at least 5 points. Neutropenia occurred in 3/30 IMS patients and in 8/31 control patients (p = 0.182).CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed an improvement of quality of life by treating breast cancer patients with IMS additionally to CAF. CAF-induced neutropenia showed a trend to lower frequency in the IMS group.",0
Development and Pilot Validation of the DuMAND Checklist to Screen for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-Associated Neurobehavioral Difficulties (DuMAND),"Background: Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) face a higher risk of neurobehavioral problems, yet an international consensus on screening, assessing, and managing these difficulties is lacking.Objective: This report introduces the term Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-Associated Neurobehavioral Difficulties (DuMAND) to comprehensively cover the spectrum of neurobehavioral issues in DMD patients, including behavior, psychiatric disorders, and various cognitive, academic, and psychosocial deficits. To facilitate screening, the DuMAND Checklist, a 43-item tool with five subscales, was developed.Methods and results: DuMAND categories were derived through literature review, parent (48 mothers and 37 fathers), and expert (n = 28) input and feedback. The DuMAND Checklist subscales were developed iteratively, incorporating item selection, expert panel (n = 10) assessment for face validity, comprehensiveness, and a pilot validation study in a DMD sample (n = 20). DuMAND encompasses five categories: cognition and learning, social responsiveness, emotion regulation, externalizing behavior, and eating and sleeping. Preliminary validation of the DuMAND Checklist indicates acceptable-to-excellent internal consistency and construct validity.Conclusion: By introducing the DuMAND concept, this study seeks to inspire a consensus approach for screening, assessing, and managing neurobehavioral issues in DMD. Incorporating screening, using the DuMAND Checklist, in addition to medical follow-up will facilitate early intervention, addressing a critical gap in identification of neurobehavioral disorders in DMD. Future research is needed to further evaluate psychometric properties of the DuMAND Checklist and investigate the natural course of DuMAND.",0
Neck and shoulder muscle activity and posture among helicopter pilots and crew-members during military helicopter flight,"Neck pain among helicopter pilots and crew-members is common. This study quantified the physical workload on neck and shoulder muscles using electromyography (EMG) measures during helicopter flight. Nine standardized sorties were performed, encompassing: cruising from location A to location B (AB) and performing search and rescue (SAR). SAR was performed with Night Vision Goggles (NVG), while AB was performed with (AB+NVG) and without NVG (AB-NVG). EMG was recorded for: trapezius (TRA), upper neck extensors (UNE), and sternocleido-mastoid (SCM). Maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) were performed for normalization of EMG (MVE). Neck posture of pilots and crew-members was monitored and pain intensity of neck, shoulder, and back was recorded. Mean muscle activity for UNE was similar to 10% MVE and significantly higher than TRA and SCM, and SCM was significantly lower than TRA. There was no significant difference between AB-NVG and AB+NVG. Muscle activity in the UNE was significantly higher during SAR+NVG than AB-NVG. Sortie time (%) with non-neutral neck posture for SAR+NVG and AB-NVG was: 80.4%, 74.5% (flexed), 55.5%, 47.9% (rotated), 4.5%, 3.7% (lateral flexed). Neck pain intensity increased significantly from pre- (0.7 +/- 1.3) to post-sortie (1.6 +/- 1.9) for pilots (p = 0.028). If sustained, UNE activity of similar to 10% MVE is high, and implies a risk for neck disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
Effects of Viewing Displays from Different Distances on Human Visual System,"The current stereoscopic 3D displays have several human-factor issues including visual-fatigue symptoms such as eyestrain, headache, fatigue, nausea, and malaise. The viewing time and viewing distance are factors that considerably affect the visual fatigue associated with 3D displays. Hence, this study analyzes the effects of display type (2D vs. 3D) and viewing distance on visual fatigue during a 60-min viewing session based on electroencephalogram (EEG) relative beta power, and alpha/beta power ratio. In this study, twenty male participants watched four videos. The EEGs were recorded at two occipital lobes (O1 and O2) of each participant in the pre-session (3 min), post-session (3 min), and during a 60-min viewing session. The results showed that the decrease in relative beta power of the EEG and the increase in the alpha/beta ratio from the start until the end of the viewing session were significantly higher when watching the 3D display. When the viewing distance was increased from 1.95 m to 3.90 m, the visual fatigue was decreased in the case of the 3D-display, whereas the fatigue was increased in the case of the 2D-display. Moreover, there was approximately the same level of visual fatigue when watching videos in 2D or 3D from a long viewing distance (3.90 m).",0
Dashcam video footage-based analysis of microsleep-related behaviors in truck collisions attributed to falling asleep at the wheel,"Objective: With the rapid spread of dashcams, many car accidents have been recorded; however, behavioral approaches using these dashcam video footage have not been sufficiently examined. We employed dashcam video footage to evaluate microsleep-related behaviors immediately prior to real-world truck collisions in pro-fessional drivers to explore a new solution to reduce collisions attributed to falling asleep at the wheel.Methods: In total, 3,120 s of video footage (60 s/case x 52 cases) from real-world truck collisions of 52 pro-fessional drivers obtained from interior and exterior dashcams were used and visually analyzed in a second-by -second manner to simultaneously evaluate any eye changes and microsleep-related behaviors (the driver's anti -sleepiness behavior, behavioral signs of microsleep, and abnormal vehicle behavior) during driving.Results: Assessment of the frequency of occurrence of each item of microsleep-related behavior in the 52 colli-sions revealed that the item touching in terms of anti-sleepiness behavior, absence of body movement in terms of behavioral signs of microsleep, and inappropriate line crossing in terms of abnormal vehicle behavior were observed at the highest rate in all drivers (46.2%, 75.0%, and 78.8%, respectively). Decreases in anti -sleepiness behavior coincided with increases in behavioral signs of microsleep and abnormal vehicle behavior, with collisions occurring within approximately 40 s of these changes. Collisions were more common among young people and in the early morning and evening.Conclusion: Our dashcam video footage-based analysis in truck collisions attributed to falling asleep at the wheel revealed the process of changes in microsleep-related driver and vehicle behaviors, classified as anti-sleepiness behavior, behavioral signs of microsleep, and abnormal vehicle behavior. Based on these findings, to prevent collisions caused by falling asleep at the wheel, it is crucial to monitor not only the driver's eyes, but also the driver's whole body and vehicle behavior simultaneously to reliably detect microsleep-related behaviors.",1
Bruxism Influence on Volume and Interleukin-1β Concentration of Gingival Crevicular Fluid: A Preliminary Study,"Bruxism is occlusal behaviour that often leads to stomatognathic system overload. Inflammatory markers in the periodontium are detectable in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). GCF production fluctuates due to various factors. Our study aimed to assess the effect of tooth clenching or grinding on GCF volume and proinflammatory IL-1 beta concentration in GCF. This pilot study was carried out on 20 participants aged 21 to 28 with good general health (per 10 people studied and control groups). GCF volume was measured with Periotron 8010 after absorbing for 30 s with PerioPaper strips. Twelve samples were collected from each patient-the buccal and lingual surfaces of teeth 16, 11, 24, 36, 31, and 44 were included. Laboratory examination of IL-1 beta concentration was performed. In patients with pathological tooth wear, a tendency to increase GCF secretion and IL-1 beta concentration in GCF was found. GCF volumes were higher in posterior teeth, while IL-1 beta levels were higher in anterior teeth. Crevices at the molars seem to have a potential predictive value in diagnosing periodontal microinflammation in patients with probable bruxism. Due to occlusal overload, these bruxists are more prone to microinflammatory processes in the periodontium. Further studies in a broader group are required to confirm this correlation.",0
"Tides modulate crevasse opening prior to a major calving event at Bowdoin Glacier, Northwest Greenland","Retreat of calving glaciers worldwide has contributed substantially to sea-level rise in recent decades. Mass loss by calving contributes significantly to the uncertainty of sea-level rise projections. At Bowdoin Glacier, Northwest Greenland, most calving occurs by a few large events resulting from kilometre-scale fractures forming parallel to the calving front. High-resolution terrestrial radar interferometry data of such an event reveal that crevasse opening is fastest at low tide and accelerates during the final 36 h before calving. Using the ice flow model Elmer/Ice, we identify the crevasse water level as a key driver of modelled opening rates. Sea water-level variations in the range of local tidal amplitude (1 m) can reproduce observed opening rate fluctuations, provided crevasse water level is at least 4 m above the low-tide sea level. The accelerated opening rates within the final 36 h before calving can be modelled by additional meltwater input into the crevasse, enhanced ice cliff undercutting by submarine melt, ice damage increase due to tidal cyclic fatigue, crevasse deepening or a combination of these processes. Our results highlight the influence of surface meltwater and tides on crevasse opening leading to major calving events at grounded tidewater glaciers such as Bowdoin.",0
Ergonomic assessment of a helicopter crew seat: The HH-60G flight engineer position,"Background: Reports of back pain among military helicopter aircrew have appeared in the aviation medicine literature since the 1960s. Likewise, anecdotal complaints of back and neck pain among HH-60G crewmembers have long persisted. The purpose of the present study was to identify specific work factors that could contribute to increased musculoskeletal discomfort among HH-60G flight engineers and gunners, and to recommend actions, to remedy observed workplace deficiencies. Methods: The physical dimensions of the HH-60G flight engineer/gunner workstation were measured, and the activities and work postures of a flight engineer and gunner were observed and photographed during flight. Measurements of crew station dimensions were compared against anthropometric data for U.S. Air Force flying personnel to estimate of the percentage of the crew accommodated by the available work area. Results. Results show that the current crew seat configuration forces the vast majority of HH-60G flight engineers/gunners to assume a variety of awkward neck, back, and lower extremity postures during flight. Based on existing epidemiological evidence, it is highly plausible that maintaining these postures for sustained periods of time could lead to increased musculoskeletal fatigue and discomfort in this population. Conclusions: Two major deficiencies that can be addressed to improve posture and reduce musculoskeletal stress among HH-60G flight engineers and gunners involve the design of the crew seat backrest, and the lack of space between the seat and the side of the aircraft for the legs and feet. Specific recommendations for crew seat design are provided.",0
Botulinum toxin for diabetic neuropathic pain A randomized double-blind crossover trial,"Background: Diabetic neuropathy is a common complication in diabetes, with patients typically experiencing diverse sensory symptoms including dysesthesias in the feet and usually accompanied by sleep disturbance. There is still no comprehensive understanding of the underlying biologic processes responsible for diabetic neuropathic pain. Thus, the current symptomatic therapy remains unsatisfactory. Recent experimental evidence suggests that botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) may not only inhibit the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junctions, but also modulate afferent sensory fiber firing, thereby relieving neuropathic pain.Methods: A double-blind crossover trial of intradermal BoNT/A for diabetic neuropathic pain in 18 patients was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness.Results: We find significant reduction in visual analog scale (VAS) of pain by 0.83 +/- 1.11 at 1 week, 2.22 +/- 2.24 at 4 weeks, 2.33 +/- 2.56 at 8 weeks, and 2.53 +/- 2.48 at 12 weeks after injection in the BoNT/A group, as compared to the respective findings for a placebo group of 0.39 +/- 1.18, -0.11 +/- 2.04, 0.42 +/- 1.62, and 0.53 +/- 1.57 at the same timepoints (p < 0.05). Within the BoNT/A group, 44.4% of the participants experienced a reduction of VAS >= 3 within 3 months after injection, whereas there was no similar response in the placebo group. At the 4-week postinjection stage, improvement in sleep quality was measured using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.Conclusions: This pilot study found that botulinum toxin type A significantly reduced diabetic neuropathic pain and transiently improved sleep quality. Further large-scaled study is warranted. Neurology (R) 2009; 72: 1473-1478",0
The Burden of Sleep Problems: A Pilot Observational Study in an Ethnically Diverse Urban Primary Care Setting.,"INTRODUCTION: Sleep disorders affect up to 1 in 4 adults and can adversely affect a variety of health conditions. However, little is known about detection of sleep disorders in ethnically diverse urban primary care settings.METHODS: Patients in urban primary care settings completed surveys to screen for sleep problems and identify comorbid conditions. Providers were given screening results, and provided feedback regarding their clinical utility.RESULTS: Participants (n = 95) were predominantly women (76.8%) and black, non-Hispanic (46.3%), or Hispanic (38.9%). High proportion of participants screened positive for insomnia (31.6%) and screened high risk for sleep apnea (42.1%). Only one-third (32.6%) of participants reported sleeping the recommended 7 to 9 hours per night. The presence of chronic pain (chi(2) = 4.97, P = .03) was associated with clinically significant insomnia. Obesity was associated with fewer hours of sleep per night, t = 2.19(87), P = .03, and risk for sleep apnea (OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.28-7.50). Participants were interested in receiving help for sleep issues during their primary care visits (40%), and providers found the screening at least somewhat useful (74.4%).DISCUSSION: Results highlight the potentially high unmet need for screening and treatment of sleep problems in ethnically diverse urban primary care settings.",0
A visual discomfort recognition model based on the fusion of multisource information,"An experiment was performed to explore the influence of image attributes (white level, black level, color saturation, and sharpness) on visual discomfort, with measurements of the subjective questionnaire, eye movement, and electrocardiogram. The objective and subjective results showed that these image attributes influenced visual discomfort significantly. A visual discomfort recognition model based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory was proposed according to the experiment results. With multiple features and weighting coefficients, the model could recognize visual discomfort states well.",0
Predicting vigilance: A fresh look at an old problem,"Individual differences in vigilance are ubiquitous and relevant to a variety of work environments in industrial, transportation, medical and security settings. Despite much previous work, mostly on personality traits, it remains difficult to identify vigilant operators. This paper reviews recent research that may point towards practically useful predictor variables for vigilance. Theoretical approaches to identifying predictors that accommodate the heterogeneous nature of vigilance tasks are compared. The article surveys recent empirical studies using personality measures, ability tests and scales for stress and coping as predictors of vigilance. Promising new constructs include trait scales linked to fatigue, abnormal personality and the stress state of task engagement. Implications of the data reviewed for occupational selection are discussed. Selection should be based on a multivariate assessment strategy, cognitive task analysis of the operational vigilance task and use of work sample measures to capture typical stress responses to the task. This review paper surveys recent research that may point towards practically useful predictor variables for vigilance. The article surveys recent empirical studies using personality measures, ability tests and scales for stress and coping as predictors of vigilance. Selection should be based on a multivariate assessment strategy.",0
Mental health and behavioural factors involved in road traffic crashes by young adults: analysis of the Raine Study,"Background Road traffic crashes (RTC) are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in young people. Severe mental health and behavioural conditions increase the likelihood of RTC, as do a range of driving-risk activities. Method We used data from the Raine Study, a prebirth cohort from Perth, Australia, to assess the relationship between measures of common mental health or behavioural conditions (Child Behavior Checklist Internalising and Externalising scores) at age 17 and subsequent RTC by 27 years, controlling for substance use and driving-risk activities. Results By 27 years of age, of 937 participants, 386 (41.2%) reported zero crashes and 551 (58.8%) reported >= 1 crashes. In the baseline Poisson model, increased Externalising scores (eg, aggression and delinquency) were associated with increased RTC (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.02): increased Internalising scores (eg, anxiety and depression) were associated with fewer RTC (IRR=0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In the fully adjusted model, the mental health measures were not significant (Externalising IRR=1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.02: Internalising IRR=0.99, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00). Risky driver activities, such as falling asleep while driving (IRR=1.34), more frequent use of a hands-free telephone (IRR=1.35) and more frequent hostility towards other drivers (IRR=1.30) increased the rate of RTC. Conclusion Measures of mental health scores at age 17 were not predictive of subsequent RTC, after adjusting for measures of driving-risk activities. We need to better understand the determinants of externalising and risky driving behaviours if we are to address the increased risk of RTC.",0
"Characterizing, controlling and eliminating residual malaria transmission","Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) interventions can reduce malaria transmission by targeting mosquitoes when they feed upon sleeping humans and/or rest inside houses, livestock shelters or other man-made structures. However, many malaria vector species can maintain robust transmission, despite high coverage of LLINs/IRS containing insecticides to which they are physiologically fully susceptible, because they exhibit one or more behaviours that define the biological limits of achievable impact with these interventions: (1) Natural or insecticide-induced avoidance of contact with treated surfaces within houses and early exit from them, thus minimizing exposure hazard of vectors which feed indoors upon humans; (2) Feeding upon humans when they are active and unprotected outdoors, thereby attenuating personal protection and any consequent community-wide suppression of transmission; (3) Feeding upon animals, thus minimizing contact with insecticides targeted at humans or houses; (4) Resting outdoors, away from insecticide-treated surfaces of nets, walls and roofs. Residual malaria transmission is, therefore, defined as all forms of transmission that can persist after achieving full universal coverage with effective LLINs and/or IRS containing active ingredients to which local vector populations are fully susceptible. Residual transmission is sufficiently intense across most of the tropics to render malaria elimination infeasible without new or improved vector control methods. Many novel or improved vector control strategies to address residual transmission are emerging that either: (1) Enhance control of adult vectors that enter houses to feed and/or rest by killing, repelling or excluding them; (2) Kill or repel adult mosquitoes when they attack people outdoors; (3) Kill adult mosquitoes when they attack livestock; (4) Kill adult mosquitoes when they feed upon sugar or; (5) Kill immature mosquitoes in aquatic habitats. To date, none of these options has sufficient supporting evidence to justify full-scale programmatic implementation. Concerted investment in their rigorous selection, development and evaluation is required over the coming decade to enable control and, ultimately, elimination of residual malaria transmission. In the meantime, national programmes may assess options for addressing residual transmission under programmatic conditions through pilot studies with strong monitoring, evaluation and operational research components, similar to the Onchocerciasis Control Programme.",0
The association ofjob fatigue with mental disorders among bus drivers,"Objective Mental disorders are a global problem with growing importance. However, the contribution of work factors to the development of mental disorders is inconclusive. This study aimed to assess the impact of fatigue and job stress on mental disorders in a prospective cohort of bus drivers.Methods The Taiwan Bus Driver Cohort Study (TBDCS) recruited 1652 bus drivers from a bus company in 2005. Participants self-completed a structured questionnaire in 2007, which included the Demand-Control-Support (DCS) model questions and the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory-Chinese (SOFI-C). Psychiatric care visits and admissions were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Dataset (NHIRD) from 2003 to 2016 for as a proxy for psychiatric diagnoses. Drivers with a history of psychiatric disorders before the questionnaire survey time were excluded (N=69). During the follow-up period, a new diagnosis with a psychiatric disorder was defined as an event. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for new one-set psychiatric disorders, adjusting for age, body mass index, marital status, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, exercise, bus driving experience, shift work, and chronic diseases.Results Among the 896 bus drivers retained for analysis, 85 were newly diagnosed with a psychiatric disorders. DCS score was not associated with the risk of developing a psychiatric disorders, but bus drivers with high SOFI-C scores (>= 5) had an elevated risk for anxiety or mood disorders (HR 3.35, 95% confidence interval 1.23-9.09). Conclusions Among bus drivers, occupational fatigue, as indicated by high a SOFI-C score, might result in an elevated risk of anxiety or mood disorders. Health service organizations should provide recommendations and guidance for drivers with high fatigue levels to avoid anxiety or mood disorders.",0
"The Faces Symbol Test, a newly developed screening instrument to assess cognitive decline related to multiple sclerosis: first results of the Berlin Multi-Centre FST Validation Study","Reliable, language-independent, short screening instruments to test for cognitive function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) remain rare, despite the high number of patients affected by cognitive decline. We developed a new, short screening instrument, the Faces Symbol Test (FST), and compared its diagnostic test characteristics with a composite of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), in 108 MS patients and 33 healthy controls. An Informant-Report Questionnaire, a Self-Report Questionnaire, and a neurologist's estimation of the Every Day Life Cognitive Status were also applied to the MS patients. The statistical analyses comprised of a receiver operating characteristic analysis for test accuracy and for confounding variables. The PASAT and DSST composite score estimated that 36.5% of the MS patients had cognitive impairment. The FST estimated that 40.7% of the MS patients were cognitively impaired (sensitivity 84%; specificity 85%). The FST, DSST and PASAT results were significantly correlated with the patients' physical impairment, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The results suggest that the FST might be a culture-free, sensitive, and practical short screening instrument for the detection of cognitive decline in patients with MS, including those in the early stages.",0
SEPARAXION ANXIETY IN PEDIATRIC MIGRAINE WITHOUT AURA: A PILOT STUDY,Background: Separation anxiety (SA) can be defined as the fear reaction and protest manifested by children when the main caregivers move away from him/her or in front of unfamiliar person. SA near eight months may be considered as an important and normal phase of the correct and typical social neurodevelopment. Aims of the present pilot study is assessing the prevalence of separation anxiety in a population of patients with migraine without aura (MwA).Materials and methods: 119 children (69 males) suffering from MwA (mean age 1.78 +/- 7: 59) were consecutively recruited. The control population consisted of 231 (114 males) healthy subjects similar for age (7.64 +/- 1: 34; p = 0.768) and gender (p = 0.987)The Screen for child anxiety related emotional disorders (SCARED) test was used to assess the prevalence of separation anxiety among MwA children.Results: Healthy individuals are on average less affected (mean 4.72 +/- 0: 32) of the Separation Anxiety Disorder respect of MwA children (mean 6.83 +/- 0.97; p < 0.001) (Figure 1).Conclusion. MwA presents many psychiatric comorbidities and among ones separation anxiety may be considered in the clinical and therapeutic management of pediatric primary headache.,0
Impact of pain on cognitive functions in primary Sjogren syndrome with small fiber neuropathy 10 cases and a literature review,"Primary Sjogren syndrome (pSS) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by xerophthalmia, xerostomia, and potential peripheral or central neurological involvement. In pSS, the prevalence of cognitive disorders is generally sparse across literature and the impact of pain on cognitive profile is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between pain, cognitive complaint, and impairment in a very homogenous population of 10 pSS patients with painful small fiber neuropathy (PSFN) and spontaneous cognitive complaint. Neurological exam, neuropsychological assessment, clinical evaluation measuring pain level, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and cognitive complaint were performed. Our results showed that 100% of patients had cognitive dysfunction especially in executive domain (80%). The most sensitive test was the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), abnormal in 70% of our population. Moreover, we found clear cut significant correlations between pain levels and 3 measures of WCST: the number of errors (R=-0.768, P=.0062), perseverations (R=0.831, P=.0042), and categories (R=0.705, P=.02). In the literature review, the impact of pain is underexplored and results could be discordant. In a homogeneous cohort of pSS patients with PSFN, a cognitive complaint seems to be a valid reflection of cognitive dysfunction marked by a specific executive profile found with the WCST. In this preliminary study, this profile is linked to the level of pain and highlights that an appropriate management of pain control and a cognitive readaptation in patients could improve the quality of life.",0
Effects of acceptance and commitment therapy on fatigue interference in patients with advanced lung cancer and caregiving burden: protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial,"Introduction Cancer-related fatigue is common in patients with advanced lung cancer. It not only interferes with patients' health-related quality of life, but also increases the caregiving burden of their caregivers. Acceptance and commitment therapy is emerging as a novel way to advocate accepting negative experiences and taking effective actions based on their own values to help patients commit meaningful actions in the course of cancer diseases. This trial aims to test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects of acceptance and commitment therapy for fatigue interference in patients with advanced lung cancer and the caregiver burden.Method and analysis A two-arm, assessor-blind pilot randomised controlled trial will be conducted. A total of 40 advanced lung cancer patient-caregiver dyads, who live in rural areas, will be recruited from a university-affiliated hospital in central China. The participants will be randomised to receive an online six-session acceptance and commitment therapy (i.e. involving metaphors, experiential exercises and mindfulness exercises facilitated by virtual reality technology) plus health education (intervention group, n=20) or health education (control group, n=20). Outcomes will be measured at baseline and 1 week postintervention. The primary outcomes are study feasibility (i.e. eligibility rate, recruitment rate, attrition rate and adherence rate), fatigue interference and caregiver burden. The secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life, meaning in life, psychological flexibility and mindful attention. Semistructured interviews will be conducted to explore the feasibility and experiences of the intervention in a subsample of 10 participants from the intervention group.Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC Ref. No. 2023.030) and the Medical Ethics Committee of Xiangya Hospital Central South University (No. 202305336). The findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and through local or international conference presentations.Trial registration number NCT05885984.",0
Development of an Efficient System for Vehicle Accident Warning,"Vehicle accidents are widespread these days. They cause loss of invaluable human lives as well as huge loss of property. An efficient accident avoidance system has been a great need since the invention of motor vehicles. We propose a vehicle accident warning system based on image processing techniques. It uses two criteria for enabling accident warning. These are driver drowsiness and front vehicle distance from our vehicle. Drowsiness, especially in long distance journeys, is a key factor in traffic accidents. We use visually observable facial behaviors as indicators of driver drowsiness. For face tracking, we use Viola-Jones face detection algorithm. The eyes region is found using a novel approach to check whether they are close or open. Other image processing techniques are used to calculate distance of front vehicles. Along with this software design, an easy to build hardware is used to complete the said system to be used in real-time. To evaluate the effectiveness of proposed system, a number of drowsy persons were tested and evaluated. Experimental results show high accuracy in each section which makes the system efficient and reliable for accident warning.",1
Cognitive effects of prolonged continuous human-machine interaction: The case for mental state-based adaptive interfaces.,"Operators of complex systems across multiple domains (e.g., aviation, automotive, and nuclear power industry) are required to perform their tasks over prolonged and continuous periods of time. Mental fatigue as well as reduced cognitive flexibility, attention, and situational awareness all result from prolonged continuous use, putting at risk the safety and efficiency of complex operations. Mental state-based adaptive systems may be a solution to this problem. These systems infer the current mental state of an operator based on a selection of metrics ranging from operator independent measures (e.g., weather and time of day), to behavioral (e.g., reaction time and lane deviation) as well as physiological markers (e.g., electroencephalography and cardiac activity). The interaction between operator and system may then be adapted in one of many ways to mitigate any detected degraded cognitive state, thereby ensuring continued safety and efficiency. Depending on the task at hand and its specific problems, possible adaptations -usually based on machine learning estimations- e.g., include modifications of information, presentation modality or stimuli salience, as well as task scheduling. Research on adaptive systems is at the interface of several domains, including neuroergonomics, human factors, and human-computer interaction in an applied and ecological context, necessitating careful consideration of each of the aforementioned aspects. This article provides an overview of some of the key questions and aspects to be considered by researchers for the design of mental state-based adaptive systems, while also promoting their application during prolonged continuous use to pave the way toward safer and more efficient human-machine interaction.",0
Initial feasibility evaluation of the RISES system: An innovative and activity-based closed-loop framework for spinal cord injury rehabilitation and recovery.,"Background: Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord may improve rewiring of the affected pathways. Immediate modulation of stimulation parameters, and its effects of it on kinematics and electromyographic variables is unclear.Methods: This study piloted the safety and feasibility of the Reynolds Innovative Spinal Electrical Stimulation (RISES) technology with a focus on its novel closed-loop setting. This personalized, task-specific non-invasive stimulation system enables real-time stimulation parameter modulation and supports multi-data acquisition and storage. Four SCI participants underwent a clinical trial coupled with activity-based training. Primary safety outcome measures included adverse events (AEs) and skin integrity; secondary measures were vital signs, pain, and fatigue assessed at the pre, mid, and post-stimulation sessions. The trial included open-loop and closed-loop blocks of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS).Results: Results showed no serious adverse events, with skin integrity unaffected. Vital signs and pain showed no significant differences across session timepoints. Fatigue levels differed significantly with post-session > mid-session > pre-session. Comparisons between open-loop and closed-loop blocks showed no significant differences in setup time, vital signs, pain, or fatigue. Average stimulation duration per task was significantly longer for open-loop (467.6 sec) than Closed-loop (410.8 sec).Conclusions: RISES, demonstrated safety and feasibility. Further work will focus on clinical efficacy.",0
ENERGY-SAVING STRATEGIES IN THE TREATMENT OF FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. A PILOT STUDY,"Introduction. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the third most common cause of neurological disability in adults, and 75-95% of subjects suffer from fatigue, which is the symptom that interferes most with activities of daily living and is the most frequent reason why patients have to stop working. Aim. To evaluate the adherence to and effectiveness of a course on energy-saving as a way to diminish fatigue and to increase the quality of life in people with MS. Patients and methods. This pilot study was almost random (although allocation to the control and intervention groups was randomised, the researchers chose the number of patients assigned to each group), with a control group of 14 patients with MS who showed signs of fatigue. Two 2-hour sessions of the course on energy-saving techniques were given by an occupational therapist in a group of nine patients. Measures were made of the self-efficiency to perforin the energy-saving strategies assessment, the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), the Short-Form health questionnaire (SF-36) and the open questionnaire on improvements in the course. Results. Adherence to treatment by participants was high (with a mean increase of 2.17) and improvements were obtained on the FIS and SF-36 scales, although they were not statistically significant. Conclusions. The degree of adherence to a course oil energy-saving strategies by patients with MS is high. Although no statistically significant improvements were found, patients did report clinical improvements in both fatigue and quality of life. [REV NEUROL 2009; 49: 181-5]",0
"RETRACTED: Application of music in relief of driving fatigue based on EEG signals (Retracted article. See vol. 2022, 2022)","In order to solve the problem of traffic accidents caused by fatigue driving, the research of EEG signals is particularly important, which can timely and accurately determine the fatigue state and take corresponding measures. Effective fatigue improvement measures are an important research topic in the current scientific field. The purpose of this article is to use EEG signals to analyze fatigue driving and prevent the dangers and injuries caused by fatigue driving. We designed the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal acquisition model to collect the EEG signal of the experimenter, and then removed the noise through the algorithm of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and independent component analysis (ICA). On the basis of in-depth analysis and full understanding, we learned about the EEG signal of the driver at different driving times and different landscape roads, and provided some references for the study of music in relieving driving fatigue. The results of the study show that in the presence of music, the driver can keep the EEG signal active for more than 2 h, while in the absence of music, the driver's EEG signal is active for about 1.5 h. Under different road conditions, the driver's EEG signal activity is not consistent. The beta wave and (alpha + theta)/beta ratio of the driver in mountainous roads and grassland road landscape environments are highly correlated with driving time, and beta wave is negatively correlated with driving time, and (alpha + theta)/beta is positively correlated with driving time. In addition, the accumulation of changes in the two indicators is also strongly correlated with driving time.",0
Endocannabinoid agonist 2-arachidonoylglycerol differentially alters diurnal activity and sleep during fentanyl withdrawal in male and female mice,"Fentanyl has become the leading driver of opioid overdoses in the United States. Cessation of opioid use represents a challenge as the experience of withdrawal drives subsequent relapse. One of the most prominent withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to opioid craving and vulnerability to relapse is sleep disruption. The endocannabinoid agonist, 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), may promote sleep and reduce withdrawal severity; however, the effects of 2-AG on sleep disruption during opioid withdrawal have yet to be assessed. Here, we investigated the effects of 2-AG administration on sleep-wake behavior and diurnal activity in mice during withdrawal from fentanyl. Sleep-wake activity measured via actigraphy was continuously recorded before and after chronic fentanyl administration in both male and female C57BL/6J mice. Immediately following cessation of fentanyl administration, 2-AG was administered intraperitoneally to investigate the impact of endocannabinoid agonism on opioid-induced sleep disruption. We found that female mice maintained higher activity levels in response to chronic fentanyl than male mice. Furthermore, fentanyl administration increased wake and decreased sleep during the light period and inversely increased sleep and decreased wake in the dark period in both sexes. 2-AG treatment increased arousal and decreased sleep in both sexes during first 24-h of withdrawal. On withdrawal day 2, only females showed increased wakefulness with no changes in males, but by withdrawal day 3 male mice displayed decreased rapid-eye movement sleep during the dark period with no changes in female mice. Overall, repeated administration of fentanyl altered sleep and diurnal activity and administration of the endocannabinoid agonist, 2-AG, had sex-specific effects on fentanyl-induced sleep and diurnal changes.",0
The effect of shock wave lithotripsy and retrograde intrarenal surgery on health-related quality of life in 10-20 mm renal stones: a prospective randomized pilot study,"The effects of treatment modalities such as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were determined in patients with renal stones between 10 and 20 mm. A total of 120 patients were included in the study and prospectively randomized to RIRS or SWL group. A total of 39 patients experienced treatment failure and finally 81 patients (45 patients in the RIRS group, 36 patients in the SWL group) were analyzed for HRQoL. SF-36 survey was used to determine HRQoL pre-operatively, post-operative day 1 and 1 month. The patient and stone characteristics such as age, gender, stone size, grade of hydronephrosis and body mass index were similar between the two groups. At post-operative day 1, the RIRS group was associated with lower scores of role functioning/physical (p = 0.008), role functioning/emotional (p = 0.047) energy/fatigue (p = 0.011), social functioning (p = 0.003) and pain (p = 0.003) when compared to the SWL group. At post-operative 1 month, only pain and emotional well-being scores (p = 0.012 andp = 0.011, respectively) in the RIRS group were statistically lower according to the SWL group. In our study, patients in the SWL group showed more favorable HRQoL scores when compared to the patients in the RIRS group in short-term follow-up.",0
"The DOC screen: Feasible and valid screening for depression, Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and cognitive impairment in stroke prevention clinics","BackgroundPost-stroke Depression, Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Cognitive impairment (DOC) are associated with greater mortality, worse recovery and poorer quality of life. Best practice recommendations endorse routine screening for each condition; yet, all are underassessed, diagnosed and treated. We seek to determine the feasibility and validity of an integrated tool (DOC screen) to identify stroke clinic patients at high-risk of depression, OSA, and cognitive impairment.MethodsAll consecutive new referrals to a regional Stroke Prevention Clinic who were Englishspeaking and non-aphasic were eligible to be screened. Time for screen completion was logged. DOC screen results were compared to the neuropsychological battery and polysomnogram assessments using a modified receiver operator characteristic and area under the curve analysis. Data is reported to conform to STARD guidelines.Findings1503 people were screened over 2 years. 89% of eligible patients completed the screen in 5 minutes or less (mean 4.2 minutes), less than half the time it takes to complete the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). 437 people consented to detailed testing. Of those, 421 completed the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression within 3 months of screening, 387 completed detailed neuropsychological testing within 3 months, and 88 had overnight polysomnograms. Screening scores combined with demographic variables (age, sex, education, body mass index), had excellent validity compared to gold standard diagnoses: DOC-Mood AUC 0.90; DOC-Apnea AUC 0.80; DOC-Cog AUC 0.81. DOC screen scores can reliably categorize patients in to low-, intermediate-or high-risk groups for further action and can do so with comparable accuracy to more time-consuming screens.ConclusionsSystematic screening of depression, obstructive sleep apnea, and cognitive impairment in 5 minutes or less is feasible and valid in a high volume stroke clinic using the DOC screen. The DOC screen may facilitate improved identification and treatment of these comorbidities to improve function in patients after stroke and in those with other neurological diseases that share these comorbid conditions (e.g. Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, Traumatic Brain Injury, multiple sclerosis).",0
Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Analysis of Triceps Brachii Muscle Oxygenation During Sprinting in Wheelchair Basketball Players: A Pilot Study,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the characteristics of muscle fatigue by measuring the oxygenation of muscles during wheelchair sprinting in wheelchair basketball players, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We believe that this information will be helpful in planning rehabilitation and training programmes.Five male wheelchair basketball players (mean age 30.0 +/- 12.0 years, mean height 166.0 +/- 12.1 cm, and mean weight 61.0 +/- 15.8 kg) participated in this study.These participants performed six 20 m sprint tests after warming up. NIRS measurements were obtained at rest before the start of exercise, during sprinting movements, and during the recovery time after sprinting. Measurements were taken using a wireless NIRS device (PortaMon, Artinis, The Netherlands; sampling rate, 10 Hz) with a single-channel system for tissue oxygenation measurements. The NIRS sensor was applied to the triceps muscle on the participant's dominant arm and fixed with an upper arm supporter. The measurement data were imported into a dedicated computer and the tissue saturation index (TSI) was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using the Friedman test to compare the TSI before sprinting and at each sprint, and a post hoc Bonferroni test was conducted.Compared to the pre-sprint measurements, TSI significantly decreased during sprints second, fourth, and fifth. In the present study, changes in the oxygen status of the triceps muscle during wheelchair driving varied greatly among individuals, and a tendency was observed towards the oxygen saturation being lowest by the fourth sprint, with the decrease being suppressed from this point on.",0
Lifestyle Changes for Improving Disease-specific Quality of Life in Sedentary Men on Long-term Androgen-Deprivation Therapy for Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Randomised Controlled Trial,"Background: Prostate cancer is a key driver of cancer-related global disability-adjusted life-years. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for advanced disease is linked to fatigue, reduced physical function, and quality of life (QoL).Objective: To evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention on disease-specific QoL, diastolic blood pressure, and cancer-related fatigue in sedentary men receiving long-term ADT for advanced prostate cancer.Design, setting, and participants: A total of 100 hundred sedentary men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer on long-term ADT were randomised to an intervention or usual care group.Intervention: A 12-wk lifestyle intervention consisting of aerobic and resistance exercise with parallel dietary advice.Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Disease-specific QoL was measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F) questionnaires at 12 wk postintervention and at 6 mo following withdrawal of support. Analysis of covariance and mixed regression were conducted.Results and limitations: Clinically relevant improvements in FACT-P were seen at 12 wk in the intervention group compared with controls (mean difference: 8.9 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7-14.2; adjusted p = 0.001). No difference was apparent at 6 mo (mean difference: 3.3 points; 95% CI, -2.6 to 9.3; adjusted p = 0.27). No difference in diastolic blood pressure was seen at either follow-up (all p > 0.05). Clinically relevant improvements in FACT-F were seen at 12 wk (mean difference: 5.3 points; 95% CI, 2.7-7.9; adjusted p < 0.001) and maintained following withdrawal of supervision (mean difference: 3.9 points; 95% CI, 1.1-6.8; adjusted p = 0.007). Improvements in exercise tolerance and behaviour were maintained at 6 mo(adjusted p < 0.001 and 0.038).Conclusions: A lifestyle intervention resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in disease-specific QoL that was not maintained postintervention. No effect on blood pressure occurred. Durability of response was seen in fatigue and exercise behaviour. Further evaluation of support structures is essential.

Improving sleep health in paramedics through an app-based intervention: a randomised waitlist control pilot trial,"BackgroundDue to work commitments, shiftworkers often obtain inadequate sleep, consequently experiencing negative health, wellbeing, and safety outcomes. Given shiftworkers may have limited control over their work commitments, lifestyle and environmental factors within their control may present an intervention opportunity. However, such interventions require tailoring to ensure applicability for this sleep-vulnerable population.MethodsA randomised waitlist control pilot trial investigated the effectiveness of mobile health application Sleepfit, which delivered a tailored sleep health intervention aimed at improving sleep health and sleep hygiene outcomes amongst paramedic shiftworkers. Outcome measures of self-reported sleep health (sleep need, duration, and quality, fatigue, Insomnia Severity Index, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores) and sleep hygiene (Sleep Hygiene Index score) were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up.ResultsFifty-eight paramedics (aged 33.4 +/- 8.0 years; 50% male) were recruited, and trialed Sleepfit for a 14-day intervention period between August 2021-January 2022. For all participants, there was a significant reduction in Insomnia Severity Index and Sleep Hygiene index scores after intervention engagement. Regression models demonstrated no significant intervention effect on sleep health or sleep hygiene outcomes (intervention versus waitlist control group). A high study drop-out rate (91.4%) prevented assessment of outcomes at 3-month follow-up.ConclusionsPilot trial findings demonstrate that Sleepfit may elicit improvements in sleep health and sleep hygiene outcomes amongst paramedic shiftworkers. However, low enrolment and retention means that findings should be interpreted with caution, further highlighting potential engagement challenges, especially among paramedics who are particularly in need of support for improved sleep.Trial registrationProspectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry 24/01/2020 (reference no.

Design and implementation of a pilot student wellness program at a school of pharmacy.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In response to concerns about student stress and well-being, a volunteer wellness task force was formed to promote a culture of wellness at the school of pharmacy (SOP). The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and implementation of this pilot wellness program.EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING: A task force was formed to design and implement a pilot wellness program for pharmacy students. Interventions included: orientation to wellness program, sessions on nutrition and mindfulness, in-class brain breaks, and promotion of on-campus resources. Student wellness was assessed at baseline with a questionnaire including sociodemographic data, perceived stress levels using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), wellness practices, and use of wellness resources. Program feedback was obtained using a post-questionnaire to identify student perceptions and preferences for wellness activities.FINDINGS: Pharmacy year one through three students (n=166) were included in the pilot wellness program, with 92.2% and 88.8% completing the baseline and post-questionnaires, respectively. There were notable changes in wellness practices compared to baseline including an increase in weekly exercise and sleeping >4 hours a night. There was greatest use of and satisfaction with 5- to 10-min in-class wellness breaks. The mean student PSS-10 baseline score was 20.14 while the post-implementation mean score was 19.62.SUMMARY: This study demonstrates the potential for implementing a faculty-driven wellness program despite limited resources. The design, implementation, and lessons learned from this pilot program may serve as a practical framework for institutions seeking to promote student wellness.",0
Sedentary Behaviors and Biomarkers Among Breast Cancer Survivors,"Background: Sedentary behavior is associated with increased risk of poor outcomes in breast cancer survivors, but underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This pilot study explored associations between different aspects of sedentary behaviors (sitting, prolonged sitting, sit-to-stand transitions, and standing) and breast cancer risk-related biomarkers in breast cancer survivors (n = 30). Methods: Sedentary behavior variables were objectively measured with thigh-worn activPALs. Breast cancer risk-related biomarkers assessed were C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and were measured in fasting plasma samples. Linear regression models were used to investigate associations between sedentary behavior variables and biomarkers (log CRP, insulin, and HOMA-IR). Results: Sit-to-stand transitions were significantly associated with insulin resistance biomarkers (P < .05). Specifically, each 10 additional sit-to-stand transitions per day was associated with a lower fasting insulin concentration (beta = -5.52; 95% CI, -9.79 to -1.24) and a lower HOMA-IR value (beta = -0.22; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.03). Sit-to-stand transitions were not significantly associated with CRP concentration (P = .08). Total sitting time, long sitting bouts, and standing time were not significantly associated with CRP, insulin, or HOMA-IR (P > .05). Conclusions: Sit-to-stand transitions may be an intervention target for reducing insulin resistance in breast cancer survivors, which may have favorable downstream effects on cancer prognosis.",0
Vehicle Vision Robust Detection and Recognition Method,"With the rapid growth of the global economy, the global car ownership is also increasing year by year, which has caused a series of problems, the most prominent of which is traffic congestion and traffic accidents. In order to solve the traffic problem, all countries are actively studying the intelligent transportation system, and one of the important research contents of the intelligent transportation system is vehicle detection. Vehicle detection based on vision is to capture vehicle images in the driving environment through a camera, and then use computer vision recognition technology for vehicle detection and recognition. Although computer vision recognition technology has made great progress, how to improve the detection accuracy of the image to be detected is still an important content of visual recognition technology research. Intelligent vehicle visual robust detection and identification of methods of research to reduce the growing incidence of traffic accidents, improve the existing road traffic safety and transportation efficiency, alleviate the degree of driver fatigue problem are of great significance. This paper considers the intelligent vehicle environmental awareness of the key technology to the goal of robust detection and recognition based on machine vision problems for further research. The particle filter is used to extract the local energy of the image to realize the fast segmentation of the region of interest (ROI). In order to further verify the ROI, a measure learning method based on multi-core embedding is proposed, and the semantic classification of ROI is realized by integrating the color, shape and geometric features of ROI. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively eliminate false sexy ROI interest, and the algorithm is robust to complex background, illumination changes, perspective changes and other conditions.",0

Real time detection of driver fatigue based on CNN-LSTM,"Fatigue driving is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. In order to solve this problem, a new Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) based real-time driver fatigue detection method is proposed. First of all, using simple linear clustering algorithm (SLIC), the driver's image is divided into super pixels of uniform size, which are used as input of CNN, and CNN is trained to automatically learn the features of eyes and mouth contained in the image, and then the location and area of eyes and mouth are obtained by using the trained CNN. On this basis, the eye feature parameter Perclos, mouth feature parameter MClosed and face orientation feature parameter Phdown are extracted, and the above feature parameters on the continuous time series and steering wheel angle feature parameter SA are taken as the input of LSTM, and the fatigue level is taken as the output to detect the fatigue state of the driver in real time. Experimental data shows that this method can not only overcome the influence of illumination, background, angle and individual differences, but also the accuracy of detection can reach 99.78%, and the average detection time is 16.94 ms/frame.",1
"Nutritional Education Needs in Relation to Ramadan Fasting and Its Complications in Tehran, Iran","Background: Ramadan fasting is associated with some lifestyle changes. A lack of nutritional needs knowledge or the improper performance of fasting, particularly in relation to time, type and amount of food intake, can cause disorders such as indigestion, bloating, constipation, headaches and other clinical problems.Objectives: To investigate the general knowledge regarding dietary factors associated with Ramadan fasting and its related complications.Patients and Methods: This prospective, non-interventional, observational study was conducted from April to July, 2012 to coincide with the month before and the month of Ramadan. The initial participants were 600 fasting and 588 non-fasting people (aged 18 65 years, BMI 18.5-40 kg/m(2)) chosen by random cluster sampling in Tehran, Iran. A questionnaire of Ramadan fasting nutritional knowledge was developed and validated in a pilot study. The Likert scale was used two weeks before Ramadan and during the third and fourth weeks of Ramadan to estimate Ramadan-related complications. Seven-day, 24-hour food recalls were used to assess food intakes.Results: The lowest level of general knowledge was identified in the context of foods associated with hunger (22.1%) and hypoglycemia (24.8%) and the highest level of general knowledge was identified in reference to unsuitable foods for Sahar (91.4%). During Ramadan, all attributed complications increased in fasting subjects (P < 0.001). High calorie, carbohydrate, fat and protein intakes in the Ramadan diet were associated with some gastrointestinal and sleep complications (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Despite the relatively high level of knowledge in the context of the general principles of a diet to prevent Ramadan-related complications, practical training in regard to the amounts of nutrients associated with Ramadan-related complications is both necessary and recommended.",0
Eye Tracing in Real-time Fatigue Driving Monitoring System,"In the real-time fatigue monitoring system, accurate track of the driver's eyes decides the reliability and practicability of the system. In this paper the method we adopt is, for images collected by infrared CCD camera, the frame-difference method is primarily adopted to locate the area of head. Laterly, we judge the image type according to whether the statistic pixel is suitable to the characteristic of complexion. As for colored image, we make use of the characteristic of complexion clustering to locate the face then apply the hybrid projection function to track the eyes; as for the infrared image, we apply the image differential projection function to locate the candidated district-of eyes, further locate the eyes through Hough Transform. The experiment results indicate that the proposed scheme can eliminate the impact brought by light changes in driver's cab and exactly trace the eyes; meanwhile it has applied values to some extent.",1
Drowsiness Detection with Alert & Notification System,"India is considered to be a developing country, along with development in transportation sectors but road accidents are a major hurdle. According to the Transport Research Wing of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, 2019, India ranks first in the number of road accident deaths across the 199 countries and accounts for almost 11% of the accident-related deaths in the World. Road accidents occur mainly due to poor road conditions, careless driving, and sometimes due to fatigue-related causes like drowsiness while driving. This study mainly focuses on drowsiness detection while driving and a way to prevent accidents. The National Highway Safety Administration reported that drowsy driving results in 1,550 deaths, 71,000 injuries, and more than 100,000 accidents per year. The majority of drivers reported being falling asleep in less than an hour while driving. This could be prevented by monitoring the eye-lid positions of the driver and if it closes for a certain interval of time, an alert system will be invoked alerting the driver to be watchful and along with this emergency contacts of the driver will be notified of this situation.",1
Risk factors associated with degenerative glenohumeral osteoarthritis.,"Objective: Glenohumeral (GH) osteoarthritis (OA) is the third most common large joint disease, after hip and knee OA. This study aimed to identify risk factors for GH OA.Methods: We used data from the Dallas Shoulder cohort, including individuals aged 40-85. Those with confirmed GH OA based on X-ray were cases, and those without were controls. Univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariate analyses identified risk factors, including age, body mass index (BMI), sex, work-related shoulder problems, shoulder disability, dislocation, previous trauma, surgery, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, depression, heart disease, OA, night pain and overall sleep quality.Results: A total of 1827 cases and 1556 controls were identified for GH OA. In univariate analysis, significant associations with GH OA were found for increasing age (>40 to ≤50: OR 3.29, 95%CI 2.44 to 4.45; >50 to ≤60: OR 5.90, 95%CI 4.49 to 7.77; >60 to ≤70: OR 12.18, 95%CI 9.22 to 16.08 and >70: OR 16.54, 95%CI 12.47 to 21.94), higher BMI (≤19: OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.01 to 2.04; >25 to ≤30: OR 1.57, 95%CI 1.32 to 1.86; >30 to ≤35: OR 1.85, 95%CI 1.54 to 2.22 and >35: OR 1.77, 95%CI 1.28 to 2.45), prior shoulder injury (OR 1.30; 95%CI 1.12 to 1.50), shoulder surgery history (OR 0.71; 95%CI 0.57 to 0.87), shoulder pain at night (OR 1.35; 95%CI 1.07 to 1.70) and hypertension (OR 0.70; 95%CI 0.60 to 0.81). In multivariate analysis, significant associations remained for age (>40 to ≤50: OR 2.99, 95%CI 2.21 to 4.06; >50 to ≤60: OR 5.48, 95%CI 4.14 to 7.23; >60 to ≤70: OR 11.22, 95%CI 8.44 to 14.88 and >70: OR 16.65, 95%CI 12.45 to 22.17), BMI (≤19: OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.01 to 2.20; >25 to ≤30: OR 1.45, 95%CI 1.20 to 1.77; >30 to ≤35: OR 1.70, 95%CI 1.39 to 2.09 and >35: OR 1.78, 95%CI 1.25 to 2.55) and previous shoulder trauma (OR 0.80; 95%CI 0.68 to 0.94).Conclusion: We identified increasing age and higher BMI as factors associated with GH OA. Due to the large sample size, many risk factors were assessed. Since the shoulder is not a weight-bearing joint, the BMI-GH OA link is likely molecular and systemic, warranting further investigation.Level of evidence: Prognostic level III.",0
Bus Management & Road Accident Prevention System for Smart Cities,"Reckless driving is a major traffic violation, caused by exceeding the speed limit, changing lanes irregularly, the drowsiness of drivers, or influence of drugs or alcohol on them. This dangerous driving practice often results in road accidents and injury or death of many innocent people. Therefore, we have come up with a new idea for this sector. Our system intends to implement a disciplined online payment service in the buses using an android application so that we can lessen the competitive tendency of the drivers to take more and more passengers. Using the application, passengers can view the location of nearby available buses. It will save their time and reduce congestion on the buses too. We will calculate the fare in the app through the scanning of QR (Quick Response Code) in and out code by the passengers. Before getting down from the bus, passengers can press a buzzer kept in front of their seats. It will also cause the LED (Light Emitting Diode) to lighten up beside the driver so that he can stop the bus at the right stoppage. Another two features of our system are drowsiness detection of the driver and lane detection of the bus. Whenever the driver will be either drowsy or will be in the wrong lane, the pi camera kept in front of him will trace the abnormality, and also the LED will be on. As a result, the driver will be alerted for safe driving. As we all know, prevention is better than cure, so our motto is to decrease the number of road accidents to a noticeable extent by preventing the vital cause of reckless driving. Therefore, just a little bit more caution from our positions can ensure a safer life for us.",1
Effect of ballroom dancing on the well-being of cancer patients: Report of a pilot project.,"The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of ballroom dancing for patients with cancer and their partners, and develop a simple method for assessing its effects on the patients' well-being. A total of 11 pairs (14 patients and 8 healthy partners) participated. Participation was open, and there were no restrictions in terms of the type of cancer, treatment or comorbidities. An anonymous standardized questionnaire allowing participants to rate their well-being on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 1 to 10 was used. This rating was repeated at defined time points over 1 week. No adverse events occurred during the study, and the teaching methods appeared to be feasible for the patients. The well-being of all patients remained stable or increased during the class, and returned to the initial level within the following days. A total of 3 patients with a low well-being rating prior to class experienced a strong improvement during the class, which continued until the last day of observation for 2 patients. These results confirm the effectiveness of a VAS-based method for the evaluation of ballroom dancing in patients with different types of cancer undergoing different treatments, and its positive effect on the patients' well-being.",0
"A short-term intervention in a multidisciplinary referral clinic for primary care frequent attenders: description of the model, patient characteristics and their use of medical resources","Background. Frequent attenders in primary care are a professional challenge for family physicians, and the medical costs of their care can be very high. Some of them suffer from somatization and are concerned solely with their physical complaints, although somatic complaints are the most common presentation of anxiety and depression. To assess and treat these patients comprehensively, a multidisciplinary clinic was created in the community.Methods. This study describes the first 40 patients referred to the clinic. All patients completed a mental health screening questionnaire and a functional assessment of health. The utilization of medical resources was assessed by chart review for the year before and the year after the first encounter in the clinic. The intervention consisted of a comprehensive bio-psychosocial consultation where life history and medical symptoms were woven together into a new narrative. The intervention also included pharmacological treatment and short-term psychological interventions.Results. The majority of referred patients were women and their average age was 52 years. Headache was the leading symptom, followed by fatigue. The mean number of reported symptoms for each individual patient was 10. Mental health problems were mainly somatization, depression and anxiety. The average yearly costs per person of US$4035 were reduced to US$1161 the year following referral.Conclusions. The integrated approach of the clinic satisfied at least three needs: of the patient, of the referring physician and of the health maintenance organization. The results of this uncontrolled pilot study suggest that this intervention helped to modify illness behaviour, decreasing the costs of medical investigations.",0
In-Vehicle Situation Monitoring for Potential Threats Detection Based on Smartphone Sensors,"This paper presents an analysis of modern research related to potential threats in a vehicle cabin, which is based on situation monitoring during vehicle control and the interaction of the driver with intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In the modern world, such systems enable the detection of potentially dangerous situations on the road, reducing accident probability. However, at the same time, such systems increase vulnerabilities in vehicles and can be sources of different threats. In this paper, we consider the primary information flows between the driver, vehicle, and infrastructure in modern ITS, and identify possible threats related to these entities. We define threat classes related to vehicle control and discuss which of them can be detected by smartphone sensors. We present a case study that supports our findings and shows the main use cases for threat identification using smartphone sensors: Drowsiness, distraction, unfastened belt, eating, drinking, and smartphone use.",0
"Neuropsychological Training of Attention Improves MS-Related Fatigue: Results of a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Pilot Study","Background: Attentional deficits may be pathophysiologically relevant in MS-associated fatigue. Patients and Methods: Thirty MS patients with fatigue and attentional deficits in neuropsychological testing participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. The intervention group (IG; n = 14) was treated with 10 h of computerized, specific neuropsychological training performing simple reaction time tasks, whereas the control group (CG; n = 16) also runs through computerized, but unspecific neuropsychological training using tasks without time components. The subjective feeling of fatigue was assessed with the Wurzburg Fatigue Inventory for Multiple Sclerosis (WEIMuS) questionnaire, and testing of alertness was used as an objective measure at baseline and after the 2-week study period. Results: Reaction times of alertness were significantly decreased in IG but not CG after 2 weeks. The subjective feeling of fatigue was ameliorated in both groups but more pronounced in IG. Effect sizes were below 0.7 for alertness and WEIMuS scores in CG but large and clinically meaningful in IG for both measures. Conclusions: Our pilot study suggests that neuropsychological training of attention may improve both measures of fatigue. The parallel improvement of attentional deficits and subjective fatigue after specific neuropsychological training support previous findings that fatigue may be at least partially caused by impaired intensity of attention.

An ergonomic role allocation framework for dynamic human-robot collaborative tasks,"By incorporating ergonomics principles into the task allocation processes, human-robot collaboration (HRC) frameworks can favour the prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). In this context, existing offline methodologies do not account for the variability of human actions and states; therefore, planning and dynamically assigning roles in human-robot teams remains an unaddressed challenge. This study aims to create an ergonomic role allocation framework that optimises the HRC, taking into account task features and human state measurements. The presented framework consists of two main modules: the first provides the HRC task model, exploiting AND/OR Graphs (AOG)s, which we adapted to solve the allocation problem; the second module describes the ergonomic risk assessment during task execution through a risk indicator and updates the AOG-related variables to influence future task allocation. The proposed framework can be combined with any time-varying ergonomic risk indicator that evaluates human cognitive and physical burden. In this work, we tested our framework in an assembly scenario, introducing a risk index named Kinematic Wear. The overall framework has been tested with a multi-subject experiment. The task allocation results and subjective evaluations, measured with questionnaires, show that high-risk actions are correctly recognised and not assigned to humans, reducing fatigue and frustration in collaborative tasks.",1
A pilot study on the biomechanical assessment of obstructive sleep apnea pre and post bariatric surgery,"Obesity is a major risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea patients. In obese patients the severity of this risk can be reduced by bariatric surgery. This pilot study investigates the perioperative effects of bariatric surgery on obstructive sleep apnea and on the physical and biomechanical characteristics of the upper airway. Polysomnography and computer tomography data for 10 morbid obese patients promoted for bariatric surgery were conducted before surgery and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively for assessment of the oropharyngeal anatomy, and subsequent three-dimensional modelling of the airway. Mean values for the apnea/hypopnea index and body mass index significantly reduced after surgery. To combine the effect of changes in the upper airway volume and body mass index, a new volume body mass index is introduced. This index increases with a successful bariatric surgery. Although bariatric surgery leads to an effective weight reduction for all age groups, for obstructive sleep apnea patients it may be effective for middle age, less effective for 50-60 years, and further less effective for patients over the age of 60 years.",0
Self-Acupressure for Symptom Management in Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review,"Context. Acupressure is a popular nonpharmacological intervention that is increasingly proven to effectively alleviate symptoms in patients with cancer. However, the effects of self-acupressure on cancer symptom management are less clear.Objectives. This systematic review is the first to summarize the current experimental evidence on self-acupressure for symptom management in cancer patients.Methods. Eight electronic databases were searched for experimental studies that examined self-acupressure for cancer patients with symptoms and published in peer-reviewed English or Chinese journals. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool and the JBI critical appraisal checklist for quasi-experimental studies. Data were extracted as predefined and synthesized narratively. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist was used to report the intervention characteristics.Results. A total of 11 studies were included in this study, six as feasibility or pilot trials. The methodological quality of included studies was suboptimal. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in acupressure training, acupoint selection, intervention duration, dosage, and timing. Self-acupressure was only associated with reduced nausea and vomiting (P = 0.006 and P = 0.001).Conclusion. The limited evidence from this review precludes the definitive conclusions on intervention effectiveness for cancer symptoms. Future research should consider developing the standard protocol for intervention delivery, improving the methodology of self-acupressure trials, and conducting large-scale research to advance the science of self-acupressure for cancer symptom management.

An objective Human fatigue monitoring solution for Fatigue Risk Management or Reduced Crew Operations,"Thales AVS has launched an internal project to develop a solution for in flight data collection and ground tools allowing post-flight analysis of fatigue, sleepiness and sleep of crew members. This solution is developed with support from major airlines. Thirty flights have already been done and collected data show a real interest from air operators to get objective information. This confirms one of the main assumption that subjective measures are not sufficient to have an accurate and reliable evaluation of fatigue, sleepiness and sleep. Such efficient monitoring is a much needed trustworthy tool for Fatigue Risk Management (FRM) and an unavoidable first step towards Single Pilot Operations (SPO), even in cruise. Thanks to these collaborations with air operators, Thales AVS has developed a better understanding of how air operators manage fatigue risks and safety of flight operations and refined its crew monitoring technology for fatigue.",1
A 3-Step Approach for Introducing Computer-Aided Ergonomics Analysis Methodologies,"The first step of the methodology focuses on air traffic controllers situated at a workstation within an Air Traffic Control (ATC) room. The 3D CAD software RAMSIS uses manikins to represent subjects under study. Using this software, three air traffic controllers of different heights were added. The three air traffic controllers were modeled sitting at their workstation in different positions while doing typical on-shift duties, including reaching for a phone and looking at each of the three monitors at their workstation. The Joint Capacity analysis tool in RAMSIS was used to study which joints face the most discomfort on each air traffic controller. It was found that the hip joints and the shoulder joints unanimously faced the highest amount of fatigue in this setting. Suggested modifications to the control room include adjustable desks, monitors, and chairs so that different air traffic controllers can be accommodated. Potential discomfort for air traffic controllers facing ergonomic issues on the job can create vulnerabilities that extend to the public. In second step, an analysis tool is introduced for analyzing the obstruction on the window caused by computer monitors in the Air Traffic Control room. Obstruction analysis was done to investigate the need for a reorganized workspace considering the user's need to see out the window to perform their job tasks and to decrease the need for repetitive standing to see out the window. It was found that approximately 40% of the window is obscured by the monitors and therefore the monitor configuration should be changed. The projected change to a three-in-a-row monitor setup decreased the obstruction to the window and therefore improved the ergonomic setup of the workstation. In step 3, a RAMSIS simulation and analysis of the forklift blind spots helps provide improved safety for the forklift operation. A camera system with two different view angles is added to aid the forklift operator. Analysis leads to conclusions that using the camera system eliminates the forklift blind spot and allows for safer forklift operation.",0
Symptom Management Among Cancer Survivors: Randomized Pilot Intervention Trial of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback,"Chronic cancer-related symptoms (stress, fatigue, pain, depression, insomnia) may be linked with sympathetic nervous system over-activation and autonomic imbalance. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) is an indicator of autonomic dysregulation that is commonly observed among cancer survivors. HRV biofeedback (HRVB) training induces HRV coherence, which maximizes HRV and facilitates autonomic and cardiorespiratory homeostasis. This randomized, wait-list-controlled, pilot intervention trial tested the hypothesis that HRVB can improve HRV coherence and alleviate cancer-related symptoms. The intervention group (n = 17) received 4-6 weekly HRVB training sessions until participants demonstrated skill acquisition. Controls (n = 17) received usual care. Outcomes assessed at baseline and follow-up included 15-min HRV recordings (HRV Coherence Ratio), and symptoms of: stress, distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), pain, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to assess Group-by-Time interactions, pre- versus post-treatment differences in mean symptom scores, and group differences at follow-up. Mean HRV Coherence Ratios (+/- standard error) improved in the HRVB group at follow-up (baseline: 0.37 +/- 0.05, post-intervention: 0.84 +/- 0.18, p = 0.01), indicating intervention validity. Statistically significant Group-by-Time interactions indicated treatment-related improvements in HRV Coherence Ratios (p = 0.03, Pre-vs. post-treatment effect size [Cohen's d]: 0.98), sleep symptoms (p = 0.001, d = 1.19), and sleep-related daytime impairment (p = 0.005, d = 0.86). Relative to controls, the intervention group experienced trends toward improvements in stress, distress, fatigue, PTSD, and depression, although no other statistically significant Group-by-Time interactions were observed. This pilot intervention found that HRVB training reduced symptoms of sleep disturbance among cancer survivors. Larger-scale interventions are warranted to further evaluate the role of HRVB for managing symptoms in this population. Registration: NCT 03692624 www.clinicaltrials.gov",0
"Dynamic Postural Stability in Active, Adolescent Males Following Repeated Bouts of Aerobic Exercise in Hot and Temperate Environments: A Pilot Study","Introduction Proper jump-landing neuromuscular control is crucial in mitigating lower-extremity musculoskeletal injuries. The presence of fatigue, especially in extreme environments, may degrade dynamic postural stability (DPS) and result in lower-extremity injuries. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of moderate intensity exercise in hot (HOT) and temperate (TEMP) ambient temperatures and residual effects of a previous bout on DPS during a single-legged jump-landing. It was hypothesized that the participants would display worse DPS after HOT compared to TEMP.Methods Six recreationally active young males (16.8 0.7 year, 1.88 0.12 m, 83.8 +/- 19.8 kg) completed two, 60-minute bouts of exercise with 60 minutes of rest between bouts in both HOT (35 degrees C) and TEMP (22.2 degrees C). Heart rate and core body temperature (T-c) were monitored continuously, and DPS was assessed before and after each bout.Results The DPS time and condition effects were not identified (p > 0.05), but HOT elicited some notable (d > 0.20) increases in heart rate, T-c, and DPS compared to TEMP.Conclusions The DPS decrements varied between subjects suggesting individual-specific etiology. Repeated bouts of exercise in HOT may place an individual at a greater risk for injury than TEMP if proper prevention strategies are not used.",0
Impact of a fatigue management in work programme on meeting work demands of individuals with rheumatic diseases: A pilot study.,"INTRODUCTION: Work disability and job loss are serious consequences of rheumatic diseases (RDs), and fatigue is a symptom of RDs commonly reported to have an impact on work performance. A FAtigue ManagEment in Work (FAME-W) programme was developed to facilitate the self-management of fatigue in work. The present pilot study explored if FAME-W could facilitate individuals with RDs to manage fatigue in work and improve their ability to meet work demands.METHODS: Twenty-seven individuals with a variety of rheumatic diagnoses completed a 4-week, 2-h occupational therapy-led self-management programme. Each week focused on fatigue-related topics, including fatigue and activity management, pain management and joint protection, mental well-being, effective communication with employers and work colleagues, and employment legislation. Individual workplace ergonomic assessments were also offered. Study measures (work function, fatigue, pain, mood and self-efficacy) were completed prior to starting FAME-W, immediately post-intervention and 12weeks post-intervention.RESULTS: Participants (56% male) had a mean age of 43years. No significant improvements were observed immediately post-programme. However, at the 12-week follow-up, significant improvements were reported in meeting work demands (scheduling [p = 0.046], output [p = 0.002], physical [p = 0.003], mental [p = 0.016]), fatigue [p = 0.001], pain [p = 0.01], anxiety [p = 0.001], depression [p < 0.001], self-efficacy [p < 0.001] and Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2-Short Form (physical: p = 0.005; symptoms: p = 0.010; affect: p = 0.010; social: p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements were reported in participants' ability to meet various demands of their work 3months post-FAME-W. These findings suggest that FAME-W has the potential to assist individuals with RDs to meet the demands of their work, although further research is required to test the effectiveness of this intervention.",0
The Food Waste Lab: Improving food waste reduction behavior through education br,"Research has demonstrated the relevance of addressing food waste (FW) in private households in mitigating climate change. There is, however, little research on the potential of educational interventions in school settings to reduce this household FW. This paper explores the potential of education to positively shape 9th to 11th graders' behavioral determinants regarding FW reduction, and offers insights into the potential to develop FW reduction strategies. The FW-related educational intervention (Food Waste Lab) engaged the participants (n = 81) in the development and application of FW reduction strategies at home. There was a significant reduction in FW reported over time. However, this reduction cannot necessarily be attributed to the reduction strategies, but may be a result of decreasing engagement in FW measurement activities. The main contribution of the intervention was increased awareness among participants of FW as a driver of climate change. Participation in the Food Waste Lab increased the likelihood of participants using taste as a judgment criterion of edibility, and eating up leftovers. No significant changes could be identified with regard to food literacy and Theory of Planned Behavior constructs. Unexpectedly, the perceived feasibility of the FW reduction goals decreased over time. This study provides recommendations to correct this shortcoming. Notably, highlighting the ease of reducing FW at home is key to increasing the perceived feasibility of this goal and motivating participants to engage in FW reduction. Focusing on a specific behavior related to the use of leftovers is relevant when designing an intervention targeted to adolescents. Nevertheless, the study's limitations indicate that the future intervention design should consider reactance and fatigue as important constraints in educational interventions involving FW measures. Finally, this study calls for more robust experimental designs to evaluate the impact of various FW reduction interventions.",0
Thalidomide for the treatment of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasias: a case series,"Background Mucosal angiodysplasias, either inherited or acquired, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, sometimes refractory to treatment. From earlier case reports, thalidomide has been described to possess some benefits in this disease, but its benefits and risks nevertheless remain unclear.Objectives This pilot study assesses the efficacy, safety, and side-effect of thalidomide in the treatment of patients with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasias.Methods Patients with chronic angiodysplasia bleeding and requiring ongoing transfusion were eligible for this open nonrandomized study. Thalidomide was started with 50 mg/day and then increased incrementally by 50 mg every week up to 200 mg/day, if tolerated, and continued for 6 months. Adverse events, hemoglobin, blood chemistry, and blood transfusion were monitored during the treatment and for 6-months posttreatment.Results Seven patients were recruited in this study. Four patients discontinued thalidomide within 3-8 weeks, because of fatigue (two patients), peripheral neuropathy (one patient), and skin rash (one patient). All side-effects resolved when thalidomide was discontinued. These four patients required the same volume of blood transfusions per month as pre-study. In contrast, the three patients who continued 100-200 mg/day of thalidomide for 6 months did not require any transfusions during the 6 months of medication. During 6-months posttreatment of these three patients, one maintained response without any transfusion for 2 months, then required 1 U of blood every 4 weeks, one patient required 2 U of blood every 3-4 weeks, and one patient died from diabetes complications.Conclusion Thalidomide should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients who are resistant to conventional therapy, but it has a high discontinuation rate because of its side-effects.

A Prospective Pilot Study Evaluating Feasibility and Preliminary Effects of Breathe Easier: A Mindfulness-based Intervention for Survivors of Lung Cancer and Their Family Members (Dyads),"Objective: Symptom burden remains a distressing problem for survivors with non-small-cell lung cancer (stages I-IIIa). This pilot study evaluated feasibility and preliminary effects of a tailored mindfulness-based intervention, Breathe Easier, which encompasses meditation, 2 levels of mindful hatha yoga, breathing exercises, and participant interaction. Methods: Participants were recruited from 2 cancer programs in the US Southeast. A family member was required for participation. Sixty-two participants enrolled (20% recruitment) and 49 completed the intervention (79% retention). Participants chose level 1 yoga (basic) or level 2 (more advanced). Of the completers, survivors were 39% male and 65% Black. A community-based participatory research framework helped identify the specific needs and interests of potential participants and foreseeable barriers to implementation. A 2-month prospective, 1-group, pre-post design evaluated feasibility. Intervention dosage was measured using written protocols. Attendance and completion of daily home assignments measured adherence. Acceptability was assessed using a 10-item questionnaire, completed at three time points. Preliminary outcome data collected pre- and post-intervention tested the hypothesis that participants who received the 8-week intervention Breathe Easier would, post-intervention, demonstrate (a) less dyspnea, (b) less fatigue, (c) less stress, (d) improved sleep, (e) improved anxiety and depression, and (f) improved functional exercise capacity. Exit interviews were conducted, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for content using descriptive statistics. Results: Quantitative and qualitative measures indicated strong feasibility. Over time, level 1 participants had statistically less dyspnea, fatigue and improved exercise capacity, as well as improved sleep, and stress scores. Level 2 participants experienced slightly increased dyspnea and fatigue but improved sleep, stress, and exercise capacity. All participants experienced anxiety and depression within normal limits pre- and post-intervention. Five major themes emerged out of exit interviews: Learning to Breathe Easier; Interacting with Others as a Personal Benefit; Stretching, Releasing Tension, and Feeling Energized; Enhancing Closeness with Committed Partners; Refocusing on Living; and Sustaining New Skills as a Decision. Conclusions: The study offers insight into the feasibility of an 8-week in-person mindfulness-based intervention with a unique subset of understudied survivors of lung cancer and family members. Outcome data interpretation is limited by the 1-group design and sample size.",0
IOT based Real-time Drowsy Driving Detection System for the Prevention of Road Accidents,"At present time, drowsy driving has become one of the major issues of the traffic collision. According to statistics, a large number of road accidents occur due to drowsy driving which results in severe injuries and deaths. For this reason, various studies were done in designing systems that can examine the driver fatigue and alert him beforehand, thus preventing him to fall asleep behind the wheel and cause an accident. Some traditional approaches used vehicle-based measures to design their system, however, such measurements are highly influenced by the structure of the road, type of vehicle and the driving skill. Other approaches used psychological measures for their system that tend to provide better accuracy in monitoring the drowsiness of the driver. However, such techniques are usually intrusive as electrodes are required to be placed on the head and body. Furthermore, there are few existing researches in which subjective measurements are used as the input for the system, but, such methods can distract the driver and lead to an ambiguous result. In this paper, we proposed a system that is absolutely non-intrusive and real-time. Our proposed system used the eye closure ratio as input parameter to detect the drowsiness of the driver. If the eye closure ratio deteriorates from the standard ratio, the driver is alerted with the help of a buzzer. For our system, a Pi camera is used to capture the images of the driver's eye and the entire system is incorporated using Raspberry-Pi.",1
A psychometric analysis of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.,"Psychometric performance of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) has not been evaluated in groups of workers. This study evaluated its use in a sample of 843 long-haul truckers. Interitem correlations and Cronbach's alpha were conducted. Correlation of the ESS with the sleep problems subscale of the Trucker Strain Monitor (TSM) was performed. Dimensionality was evaluated using factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha (.79) was strong. Interitem correlations were significant. A weak but significant correlation between the ESS and TSM sleep problems subscale (r = .18, p = < .001) was shown. Factor analysis yielded two factors that explained 56.2% of scale variance. The ESS performed well in the current sample. It is an inexpensive, time/cost-effective instrument. It should be considered for use in studies of workers in naturalistic settings.",1
Perospirone in the treatment of patients with delirium,"Perospirone is a recently developed atypical antipsychotic with potent serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine D-2 antagonist activity. Other atypical antipsychotics including risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine have been widely used for treatment, not only for schizophrenia symptoms but also for delirium, because of their low potential to induce extrapyramidal disturbances. In the present study the effectiveness and safety of perospirone in patients with delirium are described. Thirty-eight patients with DSM-IV delirium were given open-label perospirone. To evaluate the usefulness of perospirone, scores from 13 severity items of the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 were assessed. Data were gathered from October 2003 to September 2004. Perospirone was effective in 86.8% (33/38) of patients, and the effect appeared within several days (5.1 +/- 4.9 days). The initial dose was 6.5 +/- 3.7 mg/day and maximum dose of perospirone was 10.0 +/- 5.3 mg/day. There were no serious adverse effects. However, increased fatigue (15.2%), sleepiness (6.1%), akathisia (3.0%) and a decline in blood pressure (3.0%) were observed. It is proposed that perospirone may be another safe and effective atypical antipsychotic drug for the treatment of delirium symptoms in hospitalized patients.

Preoperative Sleep Disruption and Postoperative Delirium,"Study Objectives: To describe preoperative and postoperative sleep disruption and its relationship to postoperative delirium.Design: Prospective cohort study with 6 time points (3 nights pre-hospitalization and 3 nights post-surgery).Setting: University medical center.Patients: The sample consisted of 50 English-speaking patients >= 40 years of age scheduled for major non-cardiac surgery, with an anticipated hospital stay >= 3 days.Interventions: None.Measurements and results: Sleep was measured before and after surgery for a total of 6 days using a wrist actigraph to quantify movement in a continuous fashion. Postoperative delirium was measured by a structured interview using the Confusion Assessment Method. Sleep variables for patients with (n = 7) and without (n = 43) postoperative delirium were compared using the unpaired Student t-tests or chi(2) tests. Repeated measures analysis of variance for the 6 days was used to examine within-subject changes over time and between group differences. The mean age of the patients was 66 +/- 11 years (range 43-91 years), and it was not associated with sleep variables or postoperative delirium. The incidence of postoperative delirium observed during any of the 3 postoperative days was 14%. For the 7 patients who subsequently developed postoperative delirium, wake after sleep onset (WASO) as a percentage of total sleep time was significantly higher (44% +/- 22%) during the night before surgery compared to the patients who did not subsequently developed delirium (21% +/- 20%, p = 0.012). This sleep disruption continued postoperatively, and to a greater extent, for the first 2 nights after surgery. Patients with WASO < 10% did not experience postoperative delirium. Self-reported sleep disturbance did not differ between patients with vs. without postoperative delirium.Conclusions: In this pilot study of adults over 40 years of age, sleep disruption was more severe before surgery in the patients who experienced postoperative delirium. A future larger study is necessary to confirm our results and determine if poor sleep is associated with delirium in larger samples and what specific sleep problems best predict postoperative delirium in older surgical patients.",0
Does Implementation of Biomathematical Models Mitigate Fatigue and Fatigue-related Risks in Emergency Medical Services Operations? A Systematic Review,"Background: Work schedules like those of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel have been associated with increased risk of fatigue-related impairment. Biomathematical modeling is a means of objectively estimating the potential impacts of fatigue on performance, which may be used in the mitigation of fatigue-related safety risks. In the context of EMS operations, our objective was to assess the evidence in the literature regarding the effectiveness of using biomathematical models to help mitigate fatigue and fatigue-related risks. Methods: A systematic review of the evidence evaluating the use of biomathematical models to manage fatigue in EMS personnel or similar shift workers was performed. Procedures proposed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology were used to summarize and rate the certainty in the evidence. Potential bias attached to retained studies was documented using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool for experimental studies. Results: The literature search strategy, which focused on both EMS personnel and non-EMS shift workers, yielded n = 2,777 unique records. One paper, which investigated non-EMS shift workers, met inclusion criteria. As part of a larger effort, managers and dispatchers of a trucking operation were provided with monthly biomathematical model analyses of predicted fatigue in the driver workforce, and educated on how they could reduce predicted fatigue by means of schedule adjustments. The intervention showed a significant reduction in the number and cost of vehicular accidents during the period in which biomathematical modeling was used. The overall GRADE assessment of evidence quality was very low due to risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Conclusions: This systematic review identified no studies that investigated the impact of biomathematical models in EMS operations. Findings from one study of non-EMS shift workers were favorable toward use of biomathematical models as a fatigue mitigation scheduling aid, albeit with very low quality of evidence pertaining to EMS operations. We propose three focus areas of research priorities that, if addressed, could help better elucidate the utility and impact of biomathematical models as a fatigue-mitigation tool in the EMS environment.",0
Augmented Evolutionary Intelligence: Combining Human and Evolutionary Design for Water Distribution Network Optimisation,"Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been employed for the optimisation of both theoretical and real-world problems for decades. These methods although capable of producing near-optimal solutions, often fail to meet real-world application requirements due to considerations which are hard to define in an objective function. One solution is to employ an Interactive Evolutionary Algorithm (IEA), involving an expert human practitioner in the optimisation process to help guide the algorithm to a solution more suited to real-world implementation. This approach requires the practitioner to make thousands of decisions during an optimisation, potentially leading to user fatigue and diminishing the algorithm's search ability. This work proposes a method for capturing engineering expertise through machine learning techniques and integrating the resultant heuristic into an EA through its mutation operator. The human-derived heuristic based mutation is assessed on a range of water distribution network design problems from the literature and shown to often outperform traditional EA approaches. These developments open up the potential for more effective interaction between human expert and evolutionary techniques and with potential application to a much larger and diverse set of problems beyond the field of water systems engineering.",0

Moreover, the analysis revealed new information about human behavior during drowsy driving.",1
Development and psychometric testing of the nutritional and social health habits scale (NutSo-HH): A methodological review of existing tools.,"Habits represent repeated patterns of behavior over time that exert a significant influence on individual health. While specific tools exist to measure individual habits, the number of instruments capable of simultaneously exploring multiple dimensions of health is limited. This research had two main objectives: 1) to examine the literature to find existing tools for evaluating health habits, especially in the Spanish population; 2) through a methodological review, to develop and validate a tool capable of measuring multiple dimensions of health habits. The Nutritional and Social Health Habits Scale (NutSo-HH) was conceived, tested, and refined through pilot testing with cognitive interviews and expert content validation. Construct validity was explored through confirmatory factor analysis and known-group validity, while criterion validity was verified in comparison with the ``Healthy Nutrition Index for the Spanish Population.'' Reliability was assessed using omega coefficients. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded satisfactory fit indices. The final model included two second-order factors (nutritional habits and health habits) and two first-order factors (Mediterranean diet and alcohol consumption). Omega coefficients ranged from 0.521 to 0.815. The NutSo-HH Scale emerges as a valid and reliable tool to assess nutritional and social habits among Spanish young adults. This novel instrument fills a gap in the field, allowing exploration of various health determinants through a single scale and providing support for decision-making in the realm of public health nutrition.",0
A dynamic center and multi threshold point based stable feature extraction network for driver fatigue detection utilizing EEG signals,"Driver fatigue is the one of the main reasons of the traffic accidents. The human brain is a complex structure, whose function can be evaluated with electroencephalogram (EEG). Automated driver fatigue detection utilizing EEG decreases the incidence probability of related traffic accidents. Therefore, devising an appropriate feature extraction technique and selecting a competent classification method can be considered as the crucial part of the effective driver fatigue detection. Therefore, in this study, an EEG-based intelligent system was devised for driver fatigue detection. The proposed framework includes a new feature generation network, which is implemented by using texture descriptors, for fatigue detection. The proposed scheme contains pre-processing, feature generation, informative features selection and classification with shallow classifiers phases. In the pre-processing, discrete cosine transform and fast Fourier transform are used together. Moreover, dynamic center based binary pattern and multi threshold ternary pattern are utilized together to create a new feature generation network. To improve the detection performance, we utilized discrete wavelet transform as a pooling method, in which the functional brain network-based feature describing the relationship between fatigue and brain network organization. In the feature selection phase, a hybrid three layered feature selection method is presented, and benchmark classifiers are used in the classification phase to demonstrate the strength of the proposed method. In the experiments, the proposed framework achieved 97.29% classification accuracy for fatigue detection using EEG signals. This result reveals that the proposed framework can be utilized effectively for driver fatigue detection.",1
The effect of an irregular shift system on sleepiness at work in train drivers and railway traffic controllers,"Sleepiness and fatigue are frequent problems in railway transportation with occasional monotony and irregular shift schedules. This study aimed at (1) studying the prevalence of severe sleepiness in shifts and (2) examining which shift and sleep-related factors were associated with the occurrence of severe sleepiness in an irregular shift system. A total of 126 randomly selected male train drivers (Tdrs) and 104 railway traffic controllers (Tcos) were investigated using questionnaires and sleep-wake diaries. A sleep diary was used to collect information on sleepiness at work and sleeping times during the 21 consecutive days of the study. The prevalence of severe sleepiness at work (i.e. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale 7 or higher) was modelled by a logistic regression analysis for repeated measurements (GEE) using different shift schedule related factors and sleep length as explanatory variables. Severe sleepiness was reported in 49% (Tdrs) and 50% (Tcos) of the night shifts and in 20% (Tdrs) and 15% (Tcos) of the morning shifts. The odds ratios showed that the risk for severe sleepiness was 6-14 times higher in the night shift and about twice as high in the morning shift compared with the day shift. Age affected the two occupational samples differently: with Tdrs increased age was associated with an additional 8% reduction of risk for severe sleepiness for each year of age, while the Tcos did not show any age dependency. Shift length increased the risk by 15% for each hour of the shift and main sleep period decreased the risk by 15% for each hour of the main sleep. The risk of severe sleepiness was not consistently related to the time-off period before the shifts. The results indicate that adjustments for shift timing, length and off-duty time, in addition to actions aiming at extending the main sleep period, would probably decrease severe sleepiness in railway transportation.",1
Sleep and sleepiness during an ultra long-range flight operation between the Middle East and United States,"This study provides a practical example of fatigue risk management in aviation. The sleep and sleepiness of 44 pilots (11 trips x 4 pilot crew) working an ultra long-range (ULR; flight time >16h) round-trip operation between Doha and Houston was assessed. Sleep was assessed using activity monitors and self-reported sleep diaries. Mean Karolinska Sleepiness Scores (KSS) for climb and descent did not exceed 5 (neither alert nor sleepy). Mean daily sleep duration was maintained above 6.3 h throughout the operation. During in-flight rest periods, 98% of pilots obtained sleep and sleepiness was subsequently reduced. On layover (49.5 h) crew were advised to sleep on Doha or Universal Co-ordinated Time (UTC), but 64% slept during the local (social) night time. Pilots originating from regions with a siesta culture were more likely to nap and made particularly effective use of their daytime in-flight rest periods. The results indicate that the operation is well designed from a fatigue management perspective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
Cognitive Workload and Psychophysiological Parameters During Multitask Activity in Helicopter Pilots,"BACKGROUND: Helicopter pilots are involved in a complex multitask activity, implying overuse of cognitive resources, which may result in piloting task impairment or in decision-making failure. Studies usually investigate this phenomenon in well-controlled, poorly ecological situations by focusing on the correlation between physiological values and either cognitive workload or emotional state. This study aimed at jointly exploring workload induced by a realistic simulated helicopter flight mission and emotional state, as well as physiological markers.METHOD: The experiment took place in the helicopter full flight dynamic simulator. Six participants had to fly on two missions. Workload level, skin conductance, RMS-EMG, and emotional state were assessed.RESULTS: Joint analysis of psychological and physiological parameters associated with workload estimation revealed particular dynamics in each of three profiles. 1) Expert pilots showed a slight increase of measured physiological parameters associated with the increase in difficulty level. Workload estimates never reached the highest level and the emotional state for this profile only referred to positive emotions with low emotional intensity. 2) Non-Expert pilots showed increasing physiological values as the perceived workload increased. However, their emotional state referred to either positive or negative emotions, with a greater variability in emotional intensity. 3) Intermediate pilots were similar to Expert pilots regarding emotional states and similar to Non-Expert pilots regarding physiological patterns.DISCUSSION: Overall, high interindividual variability of these results highlight the complex link between physiological and psychological parameters with workload, and question whether physiology alone could predict a pilot's inability to make the right decision at the right time.",0
