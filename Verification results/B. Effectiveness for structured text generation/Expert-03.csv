Associating Vehicles Automation With Drivers Functional State Assessment Systems: A Challenge for Road Safety in the Future,"In the near future, vehicles will gradually gain more autonomous functionalities. Drivers' activity will be less about driving than about monitoring intelligent systems to which driving action will be delegated. Road safety, therefore, remains dependent on the human factor and we should identify the limits beyond which driver's functional state (DFS) may no longer be able to ensure safety. Depending on the level of automation, estimating the DFS may have different targets, e.g., assessing driver's situation awareness in lower levels of automation and his ability to respond to emerging hazard or assessing driver's ability to monitor the vehicle performing operational tasks in higher levels of automation. Unfitted DFS (e.g., drowsiness) may impact the driver ability respond to taking over abilities. This paper reviews the most appropriate psychophysiological indices in naturalistic driving while considering the DFS through exogenous sensors, providing the more efficient trade-off between reliability and intrusiveness. The DFS also originates from kinematic data of the vehicle, thus providing information that indirectly relates to drivers behavior. The whole data should be synchronously processed, providing a diagnosis on the DFS, and bringing it to the attention of the decision maker in real time. Next, making the information available can be permanent or intermittent (or even undelivered), and may also depend on the automation level. Such interface can include recommendations for decision support or simply give neutral instruction. Mapping of relevant psychophysiological and behavioral indicators for DFS will enable practitioners and researchers provide reliable estimates, fitted to the level of automation.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['physiological data acquisition', 'equipment-based data acquisition']}",8,6
Data fusion for driver drowsiness recognition: A multimodal perspective,"Drowsiness is characterized by decreased alertness and an increased inclination to fall asleep, typically from factors such as fatigue, sleep deprivation, or other related influences. In the context of driving, drowsiness poses substantial safety risks. The detection of driver drowsiness is of paramount importance in ensuring road safety, contributing to a significant number of accidents worldwide. Utilizing AI for drowsiness detection offers a potent solution to enhance road safety by identifying driver fatigue and preventing potential accidents. The proposed system addresses the challenge of detecting driver drowsiness using a WACHSens dataset collected from both manual and automated driving modes, encompassing rested and fatigued states. Various data sources, including vehicle-related information, facial expressions, and bio signals are employed to create a robust drowsiness detection system. A novel approach that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively detect drowsiness in drivers and achieve a 96 % accuracy level. It helps in enhancing road safety by devising effective drowsiness detection mechanisms, potentially preventing accidents and saving lives. Recall, accuracy, f1-score, and precision are the performance metrics to measure the drowsiness condition.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['equipment-based', 'behavioral', 'physiological']}",7,5
EEG index for control operators' mental fatigue monitoring using interactions between brain regions,"Mental fatigue is a gradual and cumulative phenomenon induced by the time spent on a tedious but mentally demanding task, which is associated with a decrease in vigilance. It may be dangerous for operators controlling air traffic or monitoring plants. An index that estimates this state on-line from EEG signals recorded in 6 brain regions is proposed. It makes use of the Frobenius distance between the EEG spatial covariance matrices of each of the 6 regions calculated on 20 s epochs to a mean covariance matrix learned during an initial reference state. The index is automatically tuned from the learning set for each subject. Its performance is analyzed on data from a group of 15 subjects who performed for 90 min an experiment that modulates mental workload. It is shown that the index based on the alpha band is well correlated with an ocular index that measures external signs of mental fatigue and can accurately assess mental fatigue over long periods of time.

Validating Photoplethysmography (PPG) data for driver drowsiness detection,"Drowsiness is one of the first casualty factors of car accidents. A large number of studies have been conducted to reduce the risk of car accidents and, many of them, are based on the detection of biological signals to determine driver drowsiness. In this way, several prototypes have been proposed but all of them are efficient in specific scenarios only. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive tool that allows monitoring heart activity, it is also used to evaluate driver drowsiness. This paper introduces a prototype based on PPG signals able to improve current systems in terms of evaluation time and results clearness. We performed a measurement campaign to compare experimental data with literature. The goal is to validate the prototype.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['ppg']}",7,6
Detecting Soldiers' Fatigue Using Eye-Tracking Glasses: Practical Field Applications and Research Opportunities,"Introduction Objectively determining soldiers' fatigue levels could help prevent injuries or accidents resulting from inattention or decreased alertness. Eye-tracking technologies, such as optical eye tracking (OET) and electrooculography (EOG), are often used to monitor fatigue. Eyeblinks-especially blink frequency and blink duration-are known as easily observable and valid biomarkers of fatigue. Currently, various eye trackers (i.e., eye-tracking glasses) are available on the market using either OET or EOG technologies. These wearable eye trackers offer several advantages, including unobtrusive functionality, practicality, and low costs. However, several challenges and limitations must be considered when implementing these technologies in the field to monitor fatigue levels. This review investigates the feasibility of eye tracking in the field focusing on the practical applications in military operational environments. Materials and Method This paper summarizes the existing literature about eyeblink dynamics and available wearable eye-tracking technologies, exposing challenges and limitations, as well as discussing practical recommendations on how to improve the feasibility of eye tracking in the field. Results So far, no eye-tracking glasses can be recommended for use in a demanding work environment. First, eyeblink dynamics are influenced by multiple factors; therefore, environments, situations, and individual behavior must be taken into account. Second, the glasses' placement, sunlight, facial or body movements, vibrations, and sweat can drastically decrease measurement accuracy. The placement of the eye cameras for the OET and the placement of the electrodes for the EOG must be chosen consciously, the sampling rate must be minimal 200 Hz, and software and hardware must be robust to resist any factors influencing eye tracking. Conclusion Monitoring physiological and psychological readiness of soldiers, as well as other civil professionals that face higher risks when their attention is impaired or reduced, is necessary. However, improvements to eye-tracking devices' hardware, calibration method, sampling rate, and algorithm are needed in order to accurately monitor fatigue levels in the field.","{'operator type': ['none'], 'data acquisition methods': ['optical eye tracking (oet)', 'electrooculography (eog)']}",9,9
Driver-Condition Detection Using a Thermal Imaging Camera and Neural Networks,"Autonomous vehicles aim to improve driving safety and comfort. In autonomous car SAE level-3 operations, it is necessary to determine whether the driving authority can be transferred from the computer to the driver. The driver must be awake and sufficiently alert to switch to manual driving operation. Physiological measurement methods require sensors that are in contact with the human body. These sensors are annoying, frustrating, and inconvenient for the driver. The purpose of this study is to determine a driver's condition using eye-closing time and yawning frequency by a visible-light camera and a thermal camera. Eye-closings and yawns were detected using an appropriate non-contact detector with a visible camera and thermal camera. When a visible-light camera was used, the driver state recognition rate was 90 % or higher when the driver's surroundings were brightly lit, but the recognition rate decreased significantly to approximately 4 % when the surroundings were dark. Using a thermal camera, the face recognition rate was 74 % under bright and dark conditions. For the thermal images, DLib and OpenCV could be performed well. Therefore, the DLib and thermal image combination could be used for a reliable driver drowsiness detection task.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['visible-light camera', 'thermal camera']}",9,6
Effects of long and short simulated flights on the saccadic eye movement velocity of aviators,"Aircrew fatigue is a major contributor to operational errors in civil and military aviation. Objective detection of pilot fatigue is thus critical to prevent aviation catastrophes. Previous work has linked fatigue to changes in oculomotor dynamics, but few studies have studied this relationshipin critical safety environments. Here we measured the eye movements of US Marine Corps combat helicopter pilots before and after simulated flight missions of different durations. We found a decrease in saccadic velocities after long simulated flights compared to short simulated flights. These results suggest that saccadic velocity could serve as a biomarker of aviator fatigue.

Drowsiness Detection by Bayesian-Copula Discriminant Classifier Based on EEG Signals During Daytime Short Nap,"Objective: Daytime short nap involves individual physiological states including alertness and drowsiness. In order to have a better understanding of the periodical rhymes of physiological states and then promote a good interpretability of alertness, the aim of this study is to detect drowsiness during daytime short nap. Methods: A method of Bayesian-copula discriminant classifier (BCDC) was introduced to detect individual drowsiness based on the physiological features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. As an extension of traditional Bayesian decision theory, the BCDC method tries to construct the class-conditional probability density functions by exploiting the theory of copula and kernel density estimation. Results: The proposed BCDC method was validated with experimental dataset and compared with other traditional methods for drowsiness detection. The obtained results showed that our method outperformed other methods in terms of three evaluation criteria. Conclusion: Our proposed method is effective to detect drowsiness with superior performance. Additionally, the BCDC method is relatively robust to different parameter settings on the group-level dataset. Significance: The proposed method is likely to be a useful tool to improve the correctness of the estimated class-conditional probability density functions. Since features are extracted from spontaneous EEG recordings, the results of this study can be further generalized to other experimental environment to detect vigilance level or driver drowsiness.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eeg']}",7,6
Drowsiness monitoring based on steering wheel status,"Drowsy driving is one of the main causes of road traffic accidents. It is of great significance to study the use of steering wheel status to detect the drowsiness of the driver. In the studies of the steering wheel state, there is a general problem of the parameter selection being not comprehensive and individual differences in the way of the controlling of the steering wheel not being considered. A driving simulator was used to collect eleven parameters related to the steering wheel, where four parameters having significant correlations with driver status were selected using variance analysis. A multilevel ordered logit (MOL) model, support vector machine (SVM) model and BP neural network (BP) model were built based on the selection of the parameters. Under the same conditions of classification, the recognition accuracy of the MOL model was shown to be much higher than that of the two other models. It was concluded that the MOL model using the steering wheel parameters and considering differences among individuals outperforms the others in terms of driver's state recognition.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['equipment-based data acquisition']}",7,5
System and Method for Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Behavioral and Sensor-Based Physiological Measures,"The amount of road accidents caused by driver drowsiness is one of the world's major challenges. These accidents lead to numerous fatal and non-fatal injuries which impose substantial financial strain on individuals and governments every year. As a result, it is critical to prevent catastrophic accidents and reduce the financial burden on society caused by driver drowsiness. The research community has primarily focused on two approaches to identify driver drowsiness during the last decade: intrusive and non-intrusive. The intrusive approach includes physiological measures, and the non-intrusive approach includes vehicle-based and behavioral measures. In an intrusive approach, sensors are used to detect driver drowsiness by placing them on the driver's body, whereas in a non-intrusive approach, a camera is used for drowsiness detection by identifying yawning patterns, eyelid movement and head inclination. Noticeably, most research has been conducted in driver drowsiness detection methods using only single measures that failed to produce good outcomes. Furthermore, these measures were only functional in certain conditions. This paper proposes a model that combines the two approaches, non-intrusive and intrusive, to detect driver drowsiness. Behavioral measures as a non-intrusive approach and sensor-based physiological measures as an intrusive approach are combined to detect driver drowsiness. The proposed hybrid model uses AI-based Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (MTCNN) as a behavioral measure to recognize the driver's facial features, and the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor as a physiological measure to collect the skin conductance of the driver that helps to increase the overall accuracy. Furthermore, the model's efficacy has been computed in a simulated environment. The outcome shows that the proposed hybrid model is capable of identifying the transition from awake to a drowsy state in the driver in all conditions with the efficacy of 91%.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['galvanic skin response (gsr)', 'facial features']}",7,6
Detecting crew alertness with processed speech,"This paper proposes a solution for improving the safety of rail and other mass transportation systems through operator alertness monitoring. A non-invasive method of alertness monitoring through speech processing is presented. Speech analysis identifies measurable vocal tract changes due to fatigue and decreased speech rate due to decreased mental ability. Enabled by existing noise reduction technology, a system has been designed for measuring key speech features that are believed to correlate to alertness level. The features of interest are pitch, word intensity, pauses between words and phrases, and word rate. The purpose of this paper is to describe the overall alertness monitoring system design and then to show some experimental results for the core processing algorithm which extracts features from the speech. The feature extraction algorithm proposed here uses a new and simple technique to parse the continuous speech signal coming from the communication signal without using computationally demanding and error-prone word recognition techniques. Preliminary results on the core feature extraction algorithm indicate that words, phrases, and rates can be determined for relatively noise-free speech signals. Once the remainder of the overall alertness monitoring system is complete, it will be applied to real life recordings of train operators and will be subjected to clinical testing to determine alert and non-alert levels of the speech features of interest.","{'operator type': ['crew'], 'data acquisition methods': ['speech analysis']}",9,8
Real-Time Vision Based Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Partial Least Squares Analysis,"Robust eye state classification in real-time is very crucial for automatic driver drowsiness detection to avoid road accidents. In this paper, we propose partial least squares (PLS) analysis based eye state classification method and its real-time implementation on resource constraint digital video processor platform, to monitor the eye state during all time driving conditions. The drowsiness is detected using percentage of eye closure (PERCLOS) metric. In this approach, face in the infrared (IR) image is detected using Haar features based cascaded classifier and within the face, eye is detected. For binary eye state classification, PLS analysis is applied to obtain the low dimensional discriminative subspace, within which simple PLS regression score based classifier is used to classify test vector into open and closed. We compared our algorithm to recent methods on challenging test sequences and the result shows superior performance. The results obtained during on-vehicle testing show that the proposed system achieves significant improvement in classification accuracy at nearly 3 frames per second.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eye tracking']}",5,5
Eye Metrics: An Alternative Vigilance Detector for Military Operators,"Military operators in various environments such as cyber, remotely piloted aircraft, and image analysis are required to use sustained attention or vigilance for long periods. During this time they encounter lapses in attention attributable to the monotonous nature of their tasks. Mistakes during these tasks can have serious consequences. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of an eye-tracker to detect changes in vigilance performance during a simulated cyber operator task. Twenty participants performed 4 sessions of a 40-min vigilance task while wearing an eye-tracker. Blink frequency, blink duration, PERCLOS (percentage of eye closure), pupil diameter, pupil eccentricity, pupil velocity, and signal detection all had a significant change over time (p < .05) during the task. The significant change of oculometric measurements indicates oculometrics could be used to detect changes in vigilance for military operators. Future research is needed to assess real-time effects of these oculometrics on performance, especially in a real-world setting.","{'operator type': ['operator'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eye tracking']}",8,6
Nonlinear Analysis of Driver's Heart Rate Variability on the Prairie Highway,"The nonlinear analysis of HRV index can effectively evaluate the drivers' mental and physiological stress reaction during driving. By collecting drivers' ECG signal on the Prairie Highway and based on nonlinear analysis of HRV, it is found the drivers' Correlation Dimension (D-2) changes significantly and has a strong negative correlation with driving time, and the regression model under the Prairie Highway environment has been built in this paper. Combining the difference test between the dynamic and static index, the study has concluded drivers' sympathetic nerve activity decrease after continuous driving for 30min, and D-2 is 2.034-2.593 after 110min.The complexity of drivers' autonomic nervous system and the adjust ability of adapting to the environment decrease significantly on the Prairie Highway. These will offer the theoretical basis for monitoring driver fatigue and designing Prairie Highway.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['ecg']}",7,6
Drowsiness and Emotion Detection of Drivers for Improved Road Safety,"Often resulting in fatalities and serious injuries, drowsy driving is a key contributing factor in collisions. Drivers who are irritable or disturbed are more likely to be involved in accidents. Identifying symptoms of exhaustion and negative emotions may facilitate taking preventative measures before an accident occurs. By identifying and responding to the driver's state, cars equipped with sophisticated technology such as drowsiness and emotion detection aim to enhance the driving experience. With the use of machine learning algorithms, these cars can accurately read facial expressions to determine the driver's drowsiness and emotion. The technology may alter the vehicle's behaviour and user interface in response to the driver's state, making driving safer and more personalised. To detect driver's drowsiness different approaches are taken in this experiment such as the use of Basic CNN, ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19 and InceptionV3. Among them InceptionV3 has given 100% accuracy in the process of detecting drowsy drivers for yawn eye dataset new. In case of NITYMED dataset where video data were used, Resnet50 produced 100% accuracy. We have used InceptionV3 for detecting driver's emotion for FER2013 Dataset, which has given 68.02% accuracy. We conducted a survey on drivers regarding what affects them at the time of driving and whether a continuous monitoring system will help them or not. Almost everyone agreed on having a monitoring system for road safety.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['facial expression analysis']}",6,5
EEG-Based Index for Timely Detecting User's Drowsiness Occurrence in Automotive Applications,"Human errors are widely considered among the major causes of road accidents. Furthermore, it is estimated that more than 90% of vehicle crashes causing fatal and permanent injuries are directly related to mental tiredness, fatigue, and drowsiness of the drivers. In particular, driving drowsiness is recognized as a crucial aspect in the context of road safety, since drowsy drivers can suddenly lose control of the car. Moreover, the driving drowsiness episodes mostly appear suddenly without any prior behavioral evidence. The present study aimed at characterizing the onset of drowsiness in car drivers by means of a multimodal neurophysiological approach to develop a synthetic electroencephalographic (EEG)-based index, able to detect drowsy events. The study involved 19 participants in a simulated scenario structured in a sequence of driving tasks under different situations and traffic conditions. The experimental conditions were designed to induce prominent mental drowsiness in the final part. The EEG-based index, so-called MDrow index, was developed and validated to detect the driving drowsiness of the participants. The MDrow index was derived from the Global Field Power calculated in the Alpha EEG frequency band over the parietal brain sites. The results demonstrated the reliability of the proposed MDrow index in detecting the driving drowsiness experienced by the participants, resulting also more sensitive and timely sensible with respect to more conventional autonomic parameters, such as the EyeBlinks Rate and the Heart Rate Variability, and to subjective measurements (self-reports).","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eeg']}",6,5
Surveillance System for Abnormal Driving Behavior Detection,"The objective of this research is to detect abnormal car driving behaviors that may result in accidents. The behaviors include exhaustion from driving for a long time, taking eyes off the road, and the abnormal eye-blink from the sleepiness. The researchers are interested to develop a mobile application that analyzes car driving behaviors using a face detection algorithm. Our application is easy to install and to use on any Android based smartphone. Concretely, our mobile application considers three factors: (1) time of driving; (2) abnormal eye-blinking; and (3) taking eyes off the road. We integrate these factors with the acceleration of the driving vehicle to analyze and calculate abnormality level. Therefore, we send a voice notification to the driver when the calculated abnormality level exceeds 10. We perform experiments and experimental results show that our mobile application is feasible in realistic situations.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['time of driving', 'abnormal eye-blinking', 'taking eyes off the road', 'acceleration of the driving vehicle']}",10,8

Most current systems fail to anticipate accidents beforehand, focusing primarily on external factors. This paper introduces a novel drowsiness detection framework aimed at reducing accidents caused by drivers dozing off behind the wheel and minimizing harm to individuals engaged in prolonged computer use. The proposed method leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a semi-supervised learning technique, setting it apart from existing approaches.

Drowsy driver detection through facial movement analysis,"The advance of computing technology has provided the means for building intelligent vehicle systems. Drowsy driver detection system is one of the potential applications of intelligent vehicle systems. Previous approaches to drowsiness detection primarily make preassumptions about the relevant behavior, focusing on blink rate, eye closure, and yawning. Here we employ machine learning to datamine actual human behavior during drowsiness episodes. Automatic classifiers for 30 facial actions from the Facial Action Coding system were developed using machine learning on a separate database of spontaneous expressions. These facial actions include blinking and yawn motions, as well as a number of other facial movements. In addition, head motion was collected through automatic eye tracking and an accelerometer. These measures were passed to learning-based classifiers such as Adaboost and multinomial ridge regression. The system was able to predict sleep and crash episodes during a driving computer game with 96% accuracy within subjects and above 90% accuracy across subjects. This is the highest prediction rate reported to date for detecting real drowsiness. Moreover, the analysis revealed new information about human behavior during drowsy driving.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['facial movement analysis', 'eye tracking', 'accelerometer']}",9,9
Detecting method for drivers' drowsiness applicable to individual features,It is inevitable for driver assist and warning systems to consider the drivers' state of consciousness.

A method to extract the driver's initial stage of drowsiness was developed by means of the blink measurement irrelevant to the surrounding brightness and individual characteristics with motion pictures processing. The result was that an increase of the long eyelid closure time was the key factor in estimating the initial stage of drivers' drowsiness while driving.

Among the variables, the most important factor was neck circumference Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified severe OSA risk thresholds as neck circumference of 42.5 cm or greater and waist circumference of 122 cm or greater. Conclusions Considering neck and waist circumference rather than body mass index may facilitate informed decisions based on empirical measurements to identify OSA in driver's license applicants who require overnight polysomnography assessment.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['polysomnography', 'anthropometric measurements']}",9,8
Driver Drowsiness Detection System Based on Binary Eyes Image Data,"In this paper, driver drowsiness detection algorithm based on the state of eyes of the driver which is determined by his iris visibility has been implemented.

Once face, landmark, and facial features (such as Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR), Hands on Mouth, and if sunglasses are worn or not) get detected, PERCLOS is used for classifying if the driver is drowsy or simply blinking. An alert is given to the driver when the EAR and MAR values are less than the threshold value and YOLO detects drowsiness based on the facial features.

GAN-based EEG Forecasting for Attaining Driving Operations,"In the domain of connected vehicles or advanced driver assistance systems, electroencephalogram (EEG) data is measured in vehicles and used for applications in driver safety.

The experimental results showed that there are strong correlations between the behavior measurements and skill level. It was also confirmed that the skilled operators make their body movement small, and keep their respiration rate low and constant. In addition, it was found from multiple regression analysis that the operator's fatigue can be nearly estimated from the body movement, fluctuation of cutting force, hand wheel rotation speed, respiration period, etc.","{'operator type': ['operator'], 'data acquisition methods': ['body motion', 'cutting force', 'respiration period', 'electromyogram', 'critical flicker fusion frequency']}",8,5
Benchmarking EEG-based Cross-dataset Driver Drowsiness Recognition with Deep Transfer Learning,"It usually takes a long time to collect data for calibration when using electroencephalography (EEG) for driver drowsiness monitoring. Cross-dataset recognition is desirable since it can significantly save the calibration time when an existing dataset is used. However, the recognition accuracy is affected by the distribution drift problem caused by different experimental environments when building different datasets. In order to solve the problem, we propose a deep transfer learning model named Entropy-Driven Joint Adaptation Network (EDJAN), which can learn useful information from source and target domains simultaneously. An entropy-driven loss function is used to promote clustering of target-domain representations and an individual-level domain adaptation technique is proposed to alleviate the distribution discrepancy problem of test subjects. We use two public driving datasets SEEG-VIG and SADT to test the model on the cross-dataset setting. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 83.3% when SADT is used as source domain and SEED-VIG is used as target domain and 76.7% accuracy on the reverse setting, which is higher than the other SOTA methods. The results are further analyzed with both global and local interpretation methods. Our work illuminates a promising direction of using EEG for calibration-free driver drowsiness recognition.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eeg']}",10,7
"THE SMART AUTOMOBILE (SAM): An Application Based on Drowsiness Detection, Alcohol Detection, Vital Sign Monitoring and Lane based Auto Drive to avoid Accidents","In today's rapidly developing world where every industry's progress is contributing to adding comfort and safety to human life, the automobile industry is focusing on introducing safe, reliable and autonomous vehicles to save humans from some unbearable losses. Our research aims to serve the purpose of avoiding road accidents caused due to driver's hypo-vigilance, drunk driving or sudden health issues. The proposed system is an SoC (System on Chip) that can be easily installed in the car, it is able to accurately monitor the driver's state while driving and upon observing incapability of driving, the system switches to auto drive mode followed by a safe parking in the left lane. The developed system comprises of four parts. The drowsiness detection sub-system monitors the driver's drowsiness by employing the image processing techniques to detect his face and eyes and determine his drowsy state on the basis of Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). Alcohol is detected by analyzing the Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) levels of driver's continuously, vital signs i.e., heart rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) is measured within the car and if it is observed as being abnormal, the information is coordinated with the driver and with the aid of GSM/GPRS module, information is also forwarded to some concerned family member and emergency helpline. Upon detection of any abnormality by any of the sub-systems, the car switches to auto drive mode. This purpose is served by the auto driving subsystem. Each sub-system developed for the realization of this project is user friendly and easily adaptable within the car. The sub-systems are developed keeping cost, size, reliability and real time response constraints in consideration. Upon testing the system in real world driving scenarios, considerable accuracies are achieved by each sub-system. However, every proposed solution is subjected to some new challenges. The future research may contribute to monitor and avoid more causes of accidents for ensuring human safety and realize a system capable of wide range, safe and reliable autonomous driving.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['ecg', 'bac', 'image processing']}",7,6

Detecting Driver Sleepiness from EEG Alpha Wave during Daytime Driving,"Drowsy driving is the main reason for sleep-related crashes. We have observed that an alpha wave attenuation-disappearance phenomenon and a typical alpha blocking phenomenon commonly exist in the eye closure events during daytime simulated driving experiments. These two alpha-related phenomena prove to respectively represent two different sleepiness levels: the sleep onset and the relaxed wakefulness. Therefore, we propose a novel algorithm for tracking the alpha wave change and detecting the two alpha-related phenomena in real-time for recognizing driver sleepiness. Our proposed algorithm adopts continuous wavelet transform for charactering the signal change and support vector machine for classification. The experimental results indicate that the algorithm is able to detect the start and end points of alpha waves during eye-closed period and distinguish the two types of end points of alpha waves in two alpha-related phenomena with high sensitivity and precision. The eye-closed period detected by our algorithm with alpha waves has a high overlapping rate with that marked by human experts. The main contributions of the proposed algorithm are twofold: to detect alpha waves during the eye-closed period in real-time and serve as an indicator for judging the current sleepiness level as the sleep onset or relaxed wakefulness at the end points of alpha waves.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eeg']}",9,7
A Driver Fatigue Detection Algorithm Based on Dynamic Tracking of Small Facial Targets Using YOLOv7,"Driver fatigue detection has become crucial in vehicle safety technology. Achieving high accuracy and real-time performance in detecting driver fatigue is paramount. In this paper, we propose a novel driver fatigue detection algorithm based on dynamic tracking of Facial Eyes and Yawning using YOLOv7, named FEY-YOLOv7. The Coordinate At-tention module is inserted into YOLOv7 to enhance its dynamic tracking accuracy by focusing on coordinate information. Additionally, a small tar -get detection head is incorporated into the network architecture to promote the feature extraction ability of small facial targets such as eyes and mouth. In terms of compution, the YOLOv7 network architecture is significantly simplified to achieve high detection speed. Using the proposed PERYAWN algorithm, driver status is labeled and detected by four classes: open eye, closed eye, open mouth, and closed mouth. Furthermore, the Guided Im-age Filtering algorithm is employed to enhance image details. The pro-posed FEY-YOLOv7 is trained and validated on RGB-infrared datasets. The results show that FEY-YOLOv7 has achieved mAP of 0.983 and FPS of 101. This indicates that FEY-YOLOv7 is superior to state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed, providing an effective and practical solu-tion for image-based driver fatigue detection.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eye tracking', 'facial expressions']}",8,7
Tracker for Sleepy Drivers at the Wheel,"Sleepiness behind the wheel is the major contribution to fatal accidents. Recognizing the drowsiness of the driver is one of the surest methods for measuring driver drowsiness. In this paper a tracker has been created which plans to evaluate driver's fatigue, exhaustion, and diversion throughout driving. The framework composed is a non-intrusive constant checking framework and it consists of camera which keeps a vigilant eye on driver's movements to detect drowsiness. The algorithm developed is unique to any currently published papers, which was a primary objective of the project. The system deals with detecting eyes in an extracted image from video input. All the possible actions have been considered and output is generated accordingly. Drowsiness is determined by observing the eye blinking patterns of the driver. If eyes are found to be closed for a particular time period given by threshold value, the framework reaches the determination that the driver is nodding off and issues a notice flag. The system is implemented using Haar cascade object detector using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), which detects eyes from the input image. The system is also able to work under low lighting conditions.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eye tracking']}",6,5
Detecting Driver Drowsiness Based on Single Electroencephalography Channel,"In the recent years, driver drowsiness has been considered one of the major causes of road accidents, which can lead to severe physical injuries, deaths and important economic losses.

Our objective in this work, is to proposed an automatic approach to detect the occurrence of driver drowsiness onset based on the Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN) and using only one EEG channel. In this study, an experiment has been conducted on ten human subjects using nine features computed from one EEG channel using the Fast Fourier Transform(FFT). After introducing these features in an ANN classifier, we have obtained a classification accuracy rate of 86.1% and 84.3% of drowsiness and alertness detection.

New biomarkers for the assessment of fatigue evoked by long-term sleep deprivation based on pupillary light reflex using rheological models,"Background: The pupillary reflex (PLR) can be used to describe the function of individual segments of the visual pathway. It is modulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and clinical disorders. The results of the research on the PLR parameterization methods presented in the article show that it is possible to use the phenomenon of pupil contraction as a result of light stimulation to assess the level of sleepiness. Currently, the PLR reflex is mainly used as the primary tool to study the integrity of the sensory and motor functions of the eye. Emergency medicine physicians routinely test the pupil light reflex to assess brain -stem function. Methods: The study utilized a method for estimating the fatigue level caused by 48-hour sleep deprivation under standardized and controlled conditions through the development and implementation of the Kelvin-Voigt rheology model (KV), explaining the dynamics of the pupillary light reflex. The baseline parameters for the model were as follows: parasym-pathetic force (fp), sympathetic force (fs), pupil radius in rest conditions (r0), onset time: parasympathetic system (tp), onset time: sympathetic system (ts), product fp x tp and pro-duct fs x ts. These parameters were subject to a statistical analysis of variance and com-pared with the parameters determined by the pupillographic assessment system by AmTech, such as contraction velocity (CV), relative amplitude (RA), pupil diameter (DDil1-fast), pupil diameter (DDil2-slow), latency (Lat), time of minimum diameter (TMD), contrac-tion time (CT), redilation time (RT).Results: The statistical analysis involved the data obtained in the research experiment on a group of 18 healthy volunteers enrolled in our study (range 26-32 years, fifty percent of the study group were female). Based on the parameters from the KV model developed, the sta-tistical significance for the model indicators was determined, i.e, fp, r0, tp, ts and fp x ts, com-pared at different levels of sleep deprivation of 48 h. In addition, analysis of the determined indicators, via the AmTech pupillographic system, demonstrated that an increased level of sleep deprivation does not only result in a change in the slope and amplitude of the curve of the pupil diameter in the contraction phase, which is visualized by the CV, RA, CT param-eters, but also in the pupil dilation curve shape (Dil1-fast, Dil2-slow, RT). Sleep deprivation was observed to cause an increase of TMD and Lat. Correlation analysis presented the strongest correlations between fp and the contraction velocity r = 0.73 (p < 0.05) and the minimum pupil diameters as expressed by the RA values: 0.66 (p < 0.05). The force fp, orig-inating from the parasympathetic system, was correlated with redilation time - i.e., the lar-ger the force, the shorter the time: -0.52 (p < 0.05). It also affected the value of the pupil diameter at the end of dilatation (DDil2-slow) r = 0.49 (p < 0.05).The delay in the force tp, originating from the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), increased the duration of pupil contraction time. In this case, the correlation coefficient was r = 0.73 (p < 0.05). This was also facilitated by a delay (ts) on the part of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), leading to a delay in dilatation and thus facilitating unrestrained pupil constriction. The correlation coefficient was r = 0.7 (p < 0.05).The controlled level of sleepiness, assessed via the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) test, had increased by about 150% by the end of the experiment.Conclusion: The results of the studies indicate that the fatigue biomarkers, as determined during the pupil dilation phase (DDil1-fast, DDil2-Slow), as well as the new method for describing the dynamics of the PLR, can provide an effective and specific indicator of sleepi-ness levels. These results are also confirmed by an analysis of the Stanford Sleepiness Scale assessment results.In addition, the use of the KV rheological model to describe the curve of the pupillary reflex makes it possible, through the designated parameters of the model, to independently assess the sympathetic (fs, ts) and parasympathetic (tp, tp) activation of the autonomic ner-vous system.(c) 2022 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

A partial least squares regression-based fusion model for predicting the trend in drowsiness,"This paper proposes a new technique of modeling driver drowsiness with multiple eyelid movement features based on an information fusion technique-partial least squares regression (PLSR), with which to cope with the problem of strong collinear relations among eyelid movement features and, thus, predicting the tendency of the drowsiness. With a set of electro-oculogram signals measured in an experiment conducted in Sweden, 14 typical eyelid movement features are first extracted. Then, statistical analyses from 20 subjects indicate that the eyelid movement parameters can characterize a driver's degree of drowsiness. The intrinsic quantitative relationships between eyelid movement features and driver drowsiness degree are modeled by PLSR analysis. The developed model provides a framework for integrating multiple sleepiness features together and defining the contribution of each feature to the decision and prediction result. The predictive precision and robustness of the model thus established are validated, which show that it provides a novel way of fusing multifeatures together for enhancing our capability of detecting and predicting the state of drowsiness.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eog']}",8,7
Reliability of the Watch-PAT 200 in Detecting Sleep Apnea in Highway Bus Drivers,"Objective: To predict the validity of Watch-PAT (WP) device for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) among highway bus drivers.Method: A total number of 90 highway bus drivers have undergone polysomnography (PSG) and Watch-PAT test simultaneously. Routine blood tests and the routine ear-nose-throat (ENT) exams have been done as well.Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 89.1%, 76.9%, 82% and 85.7% for RDI > 15, respectively. WRDI, WODI, W < 90% duration and Wmean SaO(2) results were well correlated with the PSG results. In the sensitivity and specificity analysis, when diagnosis of sleep apnea was defined for different cut-off values of RDI of 5, 10 and 15, AUC (95% CI) were found as 0.84 (0.74-0.93), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79-0.94) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.97), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between Stage1+2/Wlight and Stage REM/WREM. The percentage of Stage 3 sleep had difference significant statistically from the percentage of Wdeep. Total sleep times in PSG and WP showed no statistically important difference. Total NREM duration and total WNREM duration had no difference either.Conclusion: Watch-PAT device is helpful in detecting SDB with RDI > 15 in highway bus drivers, especially in drivers older than 45 years, but has limited value in drivers younger than 45 years old who have less risk for OSA. Therefore, WP can be used in the former group when PSG is not easily available.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['watch-pat', 'polysomnography (psg)']}",6,5

Multibin Breathing Pattern Estimation by Radar Fusion for Enhanced Driver Monitoring,"Monitoring the status of the driver is a crucial aspect of health monitoring inside vehicles as it helps to identify potential health or safety risks that could affect a driver's ability to operate a vehicle safely. This includes monitoring for fatigue, distraction, or impairment, among other things, which can potentially cause car crashes. Although many solutions for health monitoring in private vehicles have been proposed, most of them are inconvenient to use or have the risk of leaking private information. Radars have the potential to address the above drawbacks by their inherent privacy protection and contactless operation in addition to their high accuracy, convenience, affordable price, and resilience to environmental factors. Among many possible radar configurations, millimeter Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars can accurately detect range and monitor displacements that are essential in breathing pattern monitoring. Breathing pattern monitoring is one of the key signatures of the driver's health. An accurate estimation of the breathing pattern enables the detection of breathing abnormalities, including Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biot, Cheyne-Stokes, and Apnea. The breathing pattern can be estimated from both the chest and abdomen. For this purpose, we employed two 60-GHz FMCW radars. The proposed algorithm is capable of detecting the mentioned breathing abnormalities through breathing rate (BR) estimation and breath-hold period detection. In addition, the proposed method in this article estimates BR based on the multiple range bins. We conducted a study on the human radar geometry problem inside a vehicle to determine the accurate number of range bins for BR estimation. The experimental results demonstrate a maximum BR error of 1.9 breaths/min using the proposed multibin technique. In addition, the dual radar fusion system can detect breath-hold periods with minimal false detections.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['radar fusion', 'contactless']}",5,5

The application of EEG signals, especially prefrontal EEG, is a potential key method for effectively determining when a driver is experiencing fatigue, which would promote the development of wearable devices for fatigue warning. In this work, we reported a rapid and effective forehead EEG-based multientropy feature-driven fatigue identification framework using a robust hybrid model. This method investigated and utilized several common entropies to enhance the characteristic quality of EEG signal, and yielded a better expected outcome than those of several classical algorithms due to the hybrid model.

Furthermore, data based on these methods are insufficient in nature due to limited simulation experiments. In this light, we propose a novel and easily implemented method based on full non-invasive multimodal machine learning analysis for the driver drowsiness detection task. The drowsiness level was estimated by self-reported questionnaire in pre-designed protocols. First, we consider involving environmental data (e.,g., temperature, humidity, illuminance, and further more), which can be regarded as complementary information for the human activity data recorded via accelerometers or actigraphs. Second, we demonstrate that the models trained by daily life data can still be efficient to make predictions for the subject performing in a simulator, which may benefit the future data collection methods. Finally, we make a comprehensive study on investigating different machine learning methods including classic `shallow' models and recent deep models. Experimental results show that, our proposed methods can reach 64.6% unweighted average recall for drowsiness detection in a subject-independent scenario.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['environmental data', 'accelerometer', 'actigraph', 'video', 'physiology']}",5,5
Integrating lightweight YOLOv5s and facial 3D keypoints for enhanced fatigued-driving detection,"Several factors cause vehicle accidents during driving, such as driver negligence, drowsiness, and fatigue. These accidents can be prevented if drivers receive timely warnings. Additionally, recent advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the monitoring of drivers and the ability to alert them when they are not focused on driving. AI techniques can analyse key facial features, such as eye closure, yawning, and head movements, to assess the driver's level of sleepiness. In response to the growing concerns surrounding drowsy driving and its potential safety hazards, this study presents a comprehensive approach for detecting a driver's attention state using an enhanced version of the You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) algorithm. By leveraging critical facial landmarks and calculating the eye and mouth aspect ratios, the method effectively identifies signs of fatigue by establishing threshold values indicative of closed eyes and yawning. This work introduces an advanced YOLOv5 model integrated with Swin Transformer modules in the feature fusion network and refined backbone network feature extraction to detect driver drowsiness. Additionally, a real-time fatigued-driving detection model, built on an improved YOLOv5s architecture and incorporating Attention Mesh 3D key points, demonstrates superior effectiveness over conventional models. The proposed method achieves a notable 2.4% enhancement in mean average precision (mAP) compared to the baseline model through extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets. By combining YOLOv5 with facial 3D landmarks, the system benefits from the complementary strengths of both techniques, leading to more accurate and robust detection of fatigue-related cues and ultimately mitigating accidents caused by drowsy driving.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['facial 3d keypoints', 'eye closure', 'yawning', 'head movements']}",7,6
Driver Drowsiness Detection System using Deep Learning based on Visual Facial Features,"Driver's drowsiness is one of the leading causes of road accidents in the UAE and around the globe. Many lives are daily lost because of drowsy driving making an automatic driver drowsiness detection system an urgent necessity for our modern society. Over the past few years, many such systems have been investigated in academic and industry research but none are yet widely used in our day to day life due to high cost, or limited effectiveness. In this paper, we present the first steps of a real-time, non-intrusive, smart drowsiness detection system that works in different real-world scenarios and lighting conditions. Our system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect the driver's face in an infrared video, then a deep neural network predicts whether the driver is drowsy or not based only on their face. Our initial experiments report a promising 94.39% prediction accuracy which outperforms many previously published work especially in night time conditions or scenarios where the driver is wearing sunglasses.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['facial features', 'infrared video']}",6,6
Real-time and Robust Driver Yawning Detection with Deep Neural Networks,"Yawning is an important indicator of drivers' drowsiness or fatigue. Techniques for automatic detection of driver's yawning have been developed for use as a component of driver fatigue monitoring system. However, detecting driver's yawning event accurately in real-time is still a challenging task, in particular in applications such as driver fatigue detection, illumination conditions vary in a broad range, driver facial features vary in size, shape, texture and degrees of distortion. In this paper, we present a deep neural network model built using transfer learning and sequential learning from yawning video clips as well as augmented images for yawning detection. As a result, unlike many other methods that follow a sequence of processes such as face ROI detection, eye/nose/mouth positioning and mouth open/dose determination, the proposed yawning detection system detect yawning events directly from video images without requiring any facial part positions. The system is robust to variations in object scales, positions and subject view angles. The system has been evaluated on publicly available yawning data sets, YawDD and NTHU-DDD, as well as a data set containing challenging yawning videos. The experimental results show that the proposed yawning detection system has the capability of detecting yawning events in high precision even when face turns away from camera up to 70 degrees, while exhibiting capability of being scale- and spatial-invariant. In addition, the model demonstrates the capability of discriminating yawning events very well from the actions involving mouth opening-closing motions such as talking and laughing.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['video-based']}",9,6
Sleep Detection and Alert System for Automobiles,"Driver sleep detection is a car safety technology which helps to prevent accidents when the driver gets drowsy. Various studies have suggested that around 20% of road accidents are fatigue related. A sleep alarm is used in a vehicle for detecting the condition indicative of the onset of sleepiness of a driver and for alerting the driver. An eye blink sensor is used to keep track of the driver's eyelid motion. If the predefined safety conditions are not met, then the driver is alerted by producing an alarming sound from the inbuilt car speakers primarily. Secondly, a vibrating device is incorporated within the driver's seat which activates when the conditions are not satisfied. Taking into account of the worst case scenario, that is, if the driver does not respond to any of these alarms then, using the proximity sensors, the obstacles around the vehicle is detected, and the brakes are automatically applied gradually.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eye blink sensor', 'proximity sensors']}",9,7
Prior knowledge-guided multi-information graph convolutional network for driver drowsiness detection,"Recently, driver drowsiness detection has received significant research attention, primarily due to the escalating number of road accidents caused by drowsiness driving. To tackle this issue, computer vision has been employed to detect drowsy states by analyzing drivers' facial expressions. However, existing methods based on computer vision often rely on one or two facial regions (i.e., eyes, and mouth) to detect drowsiness. This approach leads to a failure to account for the driver individual differences. Moreover, although facial regions are highly structured, existing methods employ non-structural architectures to model the drowsiness feature space, lacking guidance from prior knowledge and resulting in the loss of high-level detail features. To this end, we propose a prior knowledge-guided multi-information graph convolutional network (MIGCN) to address these issues for driver drowsiness detection. Compared to driver drowsiness detection methods based on CNN models, the structural MIGCN can effectively learn spatial facial features, enhancing feature representation. Additionally, the core of the proposed MIGCN consists of three modules: the multi-source features extraction module (MSFE), the multi-information representation module (MIRM), and the multi-information GCN and fusion module (MIGCN-F). The MSFE extracts multi-source features from five prior knowledge and entire facial regions to enhance the drowsiness feature space. These prior knowledge provide detailed information, and the entire facial region offers global high-level information. The MIRM injects class, attention, and temporal information into the multi-source features and also provides mean features from the same class, resulting in enriched multi-information features. Together, the MSFE and MIRM address the issue of drivers individual differences. Additionally, we design a task-driven novel MIGCN-F module, whose nodes are composed of multi-information features. This design not only preserves the multi-information of each node but also models the spatial relationships among multi-information features, thereby extracting more discriminative features. Experimental results on the DROZY and UTA-RLDD datasets show that MIGCN achieves accuracy of 94.78% and 97.52%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 1.68% and 2.84%, thus demonstrating its effectiveness.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['facial expressions', 'eye-related']}",7,6
Innovative Saliency based Deep Driving Scene Understanding System for Automatic Safety Assessment in Next-Generation Cars,"Visual saliency is the human attention mechanism that encodes such visio-sensing information to extract features from the observation scene. In the last few years, visual saliency estimation has received significant research interests in the automotive field. While driving the vehicle, the car driver focuses on specific objects rather than others by deterministic braindriven saliency mechanisms inherent perceptual activity. In this study, we propose an intelligent system that combines a driver's drowsiness detector with a saliency-based scene understanding pipeline. Specifically, we implemented ad-hoc 3D pre-trained Semantic Segmentation Deep Network to process the frames captured by automotive-grade camera device placed outside the car. We used an embedded platform based on the STA1295 core (ARM A7 Dual-Cores) with a hardware accelerator for hosting the proposed pipeline. Besides, we monitor the car driver's drowsiness by using an innovative bio-sensor installed on the steering wheel, to collect the PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) signal. Ad-hoc 1D Temporal Deep Convolutional Network has been designed to classify the collected PPG time-series in order to assess the driver's attention level. Finally, we compare the detected car driver's attention level with corresponding saliencybased scene classification in order to assess the overall safety level.

Driver Model for Take-Over-Request in Autonomous Vehicles,"This work presents a driver model for Take-Over-Request (TOR) in autonomous vehicles (AVs) that considers the driver's mental state and response time during the transition from automatic to manual driving modes. The Fallback Ready User (FRU) is introduced as a key component that defines the minimum attention required from the driver to respond to TORs and system failures. Highly adaptive FRU models are essential for ensuring the safety of AVs. By using non-intrusive methods, such as facial expression tracking, to capture the driver's mental state and improve AV safety we study shared control between the vehicle and driver during TOR. The paper presents two application scenarios for TOR analysis in ADAVEC system: detecting when the driver is ready for TOR and reacting to unpredictable situations, such as driver sickness or drowsiness. The proposed driver model considers user personalization based on high-level features, long-term changes, and real-time evidence.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['facial expression tracking']}",9,7
Selective Transfer Learning for EEG-Based Drowsiness Detection,"On the pathway from laboratory settings to real world environment, a major challenge on the development of a robust electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is to collect a significant amount of informative training data from each individual, which is labor intensive and time-consuming and thereby significantly hinders the applications of BCIs in real-world settings. A possible remedy for this problem is to leverage existing data from other subjects. However, substantial inter-subject variability of human EEG data could deteriorate more than improve the BCI performance. This study proposes a new transfer learning (TL)-based method that exploits a subject's pilot data to select auxiliary data from other subjects to enhance the performance of an EEG-based BCI for drowsiness detection. This method is based on our previous findings that the EEG correlates of drowsiness were stable within individuals across sessions and an individual's pilot data could be used as calibration/training data to build a robust drowsiness detector. Empirical results of this study suggested that the feasibility of leveraging existing BCI models built by other subjects' data and a relatively small amount of subject-specific pilot data to develop a BCI that can outperform the BCI based solely on the pilot data of the subject.","{'operator type': ['none'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eeg']}",9,6
Driver Emotion and Fatigue State Detection Based on Time Series Fusion,"Studies have shown that driver fatigue or unpleasant emotions significantly increase driving risks. Detecting driver emotions and fatigue states and providing timely warnings can effectively minimize the incidence of traffic accidents. However, existing models rarely combine driver emotion and fatigue detection, and there is space to improve the accuracy of recognition. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive and efficient detection method for driver fatigue and emotional state, which is the first time to combine them in the detection of driver state. Firstly, the captured video image sequences are preprocessed, and Dlib (image open source processing library) is used to locate face regions and mark key points; secondly, facial features are extracted, and fatigue indicators, such as driver eye closure time (PERCLOS) and yawn frequency are calculated using the dual-threshold method and fused by mathematical methods; thirdly, an improved lightweight RM-Xception convolutional neural network is introduced to identify the driver's emotional state; finally, the two indicators are fused based on time series to obtain a comprehensive score for evaluating the driver's state. The results show that the fatigue detection algorithm proposed in this paper has high accuracy, and the accuracy of the emotion recognition network reaches an accuracy rate of 73.32% on the Fer2013 dataset. The composite score calculated based on time series fusion can comprehensively and accurately reflect the driver state in different environments and make a contribution to future research in the field of assisted safe driving.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['facial features', 'perclos', 'yawn frequency']}",6,5
Comparison of different classifiers to detect symptoms of drowsiness before the vehicle is in motion using a heartbeat pulse bracelet,"The drowsiness causes an average of 328,000 crashes per year. Many technologies had been created to avoid this kind of accidents. However, the number of fatalities which involves drowsy drivers still present due to the complexity and ambiguity of this common symptom. Computer vision and some Artificial Intelligence algorithms were implemented to solve the problem while the vehicle is in motion. Many of those have not been implemented in commercial vehicles because the drowsy driver detection with real conditions is not 100% reliable. Adding to this, some other systems review the heart rate variability (HRV) while the person is driving and detects if the driver is falling asleep. However, if the person doesn't use the sensor during driving, this method is not useful. This paper presents a different approach on how drowsy driver problem can be solved before a person starts driving. A heartbeat pulse had been used to measure and calculate the number of hours that a person sleeps per day, the hour of the day and quality of sleep. Then, data were analyzed using different classifiers to decide if the driver is a potential candidate to fall sleep on the road. As a result, a comparison between different classifiers showed that, for solving this particular problem, the best method is the Support Vector Machine classifier with an average of 91.23% of accuracy.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['heart rate variability (hrv)']}",7,6
Real-Time Nonintrusive Monitoring and Detection of Eye Blinking in view of Accident Prevention due to Drowsiness,"Driver fatigue is the major cause of accidents in the world. Detecting the drowsiness of the driver is the surest ways of measuring the driver fatigue. The purpose of this paper is to develop a drowsiness detection system. This system works by analyzing the eye movement of the driver and alerting the driver by activating the buzzer when he/she is drowsy. The system so implemented is a nonintrusive real-time monitoring system for eye detection. During monitoring, the system is able to decide whether the eyes were opened or closed. When the eyes were detected closed for too long, a signal was issued to warn the driver. In addition, the system also have an option for making vibration when drowsiness was detected. The aim is on improving the safety of the driver without being obtrusive. Visual cues were obtained through eye blink rate by using a camera, which typically characterize the level of alertness of a person. These were extracted in real-time and systematically joined to check the fatigue level of the driver. The system can monitor the driver's eyes to detect short periods of sleep lasting 3 to 4 seconds. The system implemented in this approach runs at 8-15 frames per second. The application was implemented using Open CV in Raspberry Pi environment with a single camera view.

"Complexity of the instantaneous frequency variation in auditory steady-state response: A high sensitivity, high anti-interference index of mental fatigue","The quantification of mental fatigue (MF) in aviation remains a long-lasting problem which has a bearing on flight safety.

A CNN identified by reinforcement learning-based optimization framework for EEG-based state evaluation,"Objective. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data, as a kind of complex time-series, is one of the most widely-used information measurements for evaluating human psychophysiological states. Recently, numerous works applied deep learning techniques, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN), into EEG-based research. The design of the hyper-parameters of the CNN model has a great influence on the performance of the model.

Inter-subject transfer learning for EEG-based mental fatigue recognition,"Mental fatigue is one of the major factors leading to human errors. To avoid failures caused by mental fatigue, researchers are working on ways to detect/monitor fatigue using different types of signals. Electroencephalography (EEG) signal is one of the most popular methods to recognize mental fatigue since it directly measures the neurophysiological activities in the brain. Current EEG-based fatigue recognition algorithms are usually subject-specific, which means a classifier needs to be trained per subject. However, as fatigue may need a relatively long period to induce, collecting training data from each new user could be time-consuming and troublesome. Calibration-free methods are desired but also challenging since significant variability of physiological signals exists among different subjects. In this paper, we proposed algorithms using inter-subject transfer learning for EEG-based mental fatigue recognition, which did not need a calibration. To explore the influence of the number of EEG channels on the algorithms' accuracy, we also compared the cases of using one channel only and multiple channels. Random forest was applied to choose the channel that has the most distinguishable features. A public EEG fatigue dataset recorded during driving was used to validate the algorithms. EEG data from 11 subjects were selected from the dataset and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was employed. The channel from the occipital lobe is selected when only one channel is desired. The proposed transfer learning-based algorithms using Maximum Independence Domain Adaptation (MIDA) achieved an accuracy of 73.01% with all thirty channels, and using Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) achieved 68.00% with the one selected channel.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eeg']}",7,6
EDDD: Event-Based Drowsiness Driving Detection Through Facial Motion Analysis With Neuromorphic Vision Sensor,"Drowsiness driving is a principal factor of many fatal traffic accidents. This paper presents the first event-based drowsiness driving detection (EDDD) system by using the recently developed neuromorphic vision sensor. Compared with traditional frame-based cameras, neuromorphic vision sensors, such as Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), have a high dynamic range and do not acquire full images at a fixed frame rate but rather have independent pixels that output intensity changes (called events) asynchronously at the time they occur. Since events are generated by moving edges in the scene, DVS is considered as an efficient and effective detector for the drowsiness driving-related motions. Based on this unique output, this work first proposes a highly efficient method to recognize and localize the driver's eyes and mouth motions from event streams. We further design and extract event-based drowsiness-related features directly from the event streams caused by eyes and mouths motions, then the EDDD model is established based on these features. Additionally, we provide the EDDD dataset, the first public dataset dedicated to event-based drowsiness driving detection. The EDDD dataset has 260 recordings in daytime and evening with several challenging scenes such as subjects wearing glasses/sunglasses. Experiments are conducted based on this dataset and demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of our method under different illumination conditions.

An EEG Channel Selection Framework for Driver Drowsiness Detection via Interpretability Guidance,"Drowsy driving has a crucial influence on driving safety, creating an urgent demand for driver drowsiness detection. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal can accurately reflect the mental fatigue state and thus has been widely studied in drowsiness monitoring. However, the raw EEG data is inherently noisy and redundant, which is neglected by existing works that just use single-channel EEG data or full-head channel EEG data for model training, resulting in limited performance of driver drowsiness detection. In this paper, we are the first to propose an Interpretability-guided Channel Selection (ICS) framework for the driver drowsiness detection task. Specifically, we design a two-stage training strategy to progressively select the key contributing channels with the guidance of interpretability. We first train a teacher network in the first stage using full-head channel EEG data. Then we apply the class activation mapping (CAM) to the trained teacher model to highlight the high-contributing EEG channels and further propose a channel voting scheme to select the top N contributing EEG channels. Finally, we train a student network with the selected channels of EEG data in the second stage for driver drowsiness detection. Experiments are designed on a public dataset, and the results demonstrate that our method is highly applicable and can significantly improve the performance of cross-subject driver drowsiness detection.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eeg']}",5,5
Unsupervised Patterns of Driver Mental Fatigue State Based on Head Posture Using Gaussian Mixture Model,"Monitoring and interpreting of the Driver behaviour is a challenging area of research as the driver behaves unpredictably under the influence of factors such as fatigue, drowsiness, inattention, weather, traffic, and roads variations. In the studies reported in the literature, the activities of the driver are monitored through longitudinal and lateral behaviours using physiological characteristics and computer vision. However, an effective method to understand and monitor the sudden changes in the postural behaviour of the driver leading to catastrophic conditions is still outstanding. Towards developing such method, the driver head posture under different driving states is monitored in this study using inertial sensors. The data produced by the sensors is modelled using Gaussian Mixture unsupervised clustering approach. The experiments were conducted on a total of 10 young healthy subjects on MATHWORKS driver-in-loop simulator, interfaced with a virtual environment designed in Unreal Engine studio.

Finally, the patterns of each driver state are validated. The results indicate that the proposed approach is effective in identifying the driver state in an unsupervised manner.

IR-UWB Radar Based Near-Field Intentional Eyelid Movement Sensing Under Fixed Head and Body Motions,"In this paper, we introduce a method for sensing intentional eyelid movement using an impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar.

The measurement of eyelid movement can be utilized in a human computer interface or for the recognition of a driver's drowsiness. If the eyelids move up or down, the amplitude and frequency of radar signals change. We can observe these changes in a three-dimensional graph of raw radar data. Intentional eyelid movements produce some peaks or nulls on the graph. We used two methods to analyze the patterns of eyelid movement. Both methods involve fast Fourier transform (FFT) and exploit a pulse Doppler processing technique of radar signals.

Detection of Driver Drowsiness Using 3D Deep Neural Network and Semi-Supervised Gradient Boosting Machine,"Detecting drowsiness of the driver with a reliable and confident manner is a challenging task since it requires accurate monitoring of facial behavior such as eye-closure, nodding and yawning. It is even harder to deal with it when she wears sunglasses or scarf, appearing in the data set given for this challenge. One of the popular ways to analyze facial behavior has been using standard face models such as active shape model or active appearance model. These models work well for the frontal faces and yet often stumble for the extreme head pose cases. To handle these issues, we propose an approach based on recent machine learning techniques: first, 3D convolutional neural network to extract features in spatial-temporal domain; secondly, gradient boosting for drowsiness classification; thirdly, semi-supervised learning to enhance overall performance. The highest score from our submissions was 87.46% accuracy, suggesting that this approach has a potential for real application.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['behavioral data acquisition']}",7,6
Real-time assessment of daytime sleepiness in drivers with multiple sclerosis,"Background: Daytime sleepiness is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) that may jeopardize safe driving. Our aim was to compare daytime sleepiness, recorded in real-time through eyelid tracking, in a simulated drive between individuals with MS (iwMS) and healthy controls.Methods: Fifteen iwMS (age = median (Q1 - Q3), 55 (50 - 55); EDSS = 2.5 (2 - 3.5); 12 (80%) female) were matched for age, sex, education, and cognitive status with 15 controls. Participants completed self-reported fatigue and sleepiness scales including the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Percentage of eyelid closure (PERCLOS) was extracted from a remote eye tracker while completing a simulated drive of 25 min.Results: Although iwMS reported more symptoms of fatigue (MFIS, p = 0.003) and poorer sleep quality (PSQI, p = 0.008), they did not report more daytime sleepiness (ESS, p = 0.45). Likewise, there were no differences between groups in real-time daytime sleepiness, indexed by PERCLOS = 0.82). Both groups exhibited more real-time daytime sleepiness as they progressed through the drive (time effect, p < 0.0001). The interaction effect of group*time = 0.05) demonstrated increased symptoms of daytime sleepiness towards the end of the drive in iwMS compared to controls. PERCLOS correlated strongly (Spearman p = 0.76, p = 0.001) with distance out of lane in iwMS.Conclusion: IwMS show exacerbated symptoms of daytime sleepiness during a monotonous, simulate drive. Future studies should investigate the effect of MS on daytime sleepiness during real-world driving.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eyelid tracking']}",5,5
A real-time software framework for driver monitoring systems: software architecture and use cases,"The presence of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in modern vehicles has become a reality in recent years, enhancing the comfort and safety of drivers and road users. In the track to achieve full autonomous driving it is vital to include Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) as part of the automation set of systems to assure possible hand-over/hand-back actions. The development of DMS usually involve the integration of different computer vision and deep learning components. In this work we present a modular approach for rapid prototyping of DMS by defining atomic processing units (i.e. Analyzers) and the interface (i.e. Measures) between these units. This approach allows the definition of a network of Analyzers which can be easily interconnected in pipelines to perform specific DMS tasks (drowsiness, distraction, identity recognition). A key advantage of our approach is that a single step can be re-used for multiple DMS functionalities without the need to double computational resources. In addition, it is possible to test and validate different methods that share the same interfaces and produce the same measures. Therefore, it is easy to switch between different algorithms in a pipeline. The distributed processing capabilities of the resulting DMS architectures obtained from the proposed framework allow the generation of parallel processes in specialized hardware (i.e. Multi-core CPU and GPU boards) with a positive impact on real-time performance. Our DMS framework is compatible with RTMaps automotive-level platform for real-time multi-sensor data processing and the interfaces are compliant with the ASAM OpenLABEL concept paper by using VCD description format.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['none']}",8,6
Bus Drivers Fatigue Measurement Based on Monopolar EEG,"When people are tired, their conscious activities are sluggish and slow brainwaves predominant in their brains. More specifically speaking, the health of a human body may be affected, and chances of accident may arise due to the lowering of ones' alertness as a result of the reduction of activity in cerebral cortex. In this study, by means of a portable electroencephalograph machine and brain-computer interface, the brainwave of bus drivers were measured for their fatigue quality. The results indicated that through the empirical formula proposed, we were able to measure people's fatigue state with a result comparable to sophisticated medical instrument.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eeg']}",7,6
Continuous Vital Monitoring and Automated Alert Message Generation for Motorbike Riders,"We present an integrated sensor system for continuous monitoring of motorcyclists, which aims to benefit from the growing acceptance for wearable electronics, but goes beyond the most common life-style applications by trying to improve the user's safety. Our system features a textile front end (garment, e.g. shirt) with integrated ECG electrodes and respiration sensor as well as electronics for data acquisition, signal conditioning and onboard processing. ECG and respiration signals are processed not only to give the user feedback on his health status, but are further analyzed to detect fatigue and trigger a driver warning and thus avoid critical situations. In addition inertial sensors are used to detect accidents and trigger an emergency call, compliant to the eCall standard, if necessary. In case of an accidents health data can be online provided to first responders, before they reach the accident site.

Driver Drowsiness Detection in Facial Images,"Extracting effective features of fatigue in images and videos is an open problem. This paper introduces a face image descriptor that can be used for discriminating driver fatigue in static frames. In this method, first, each facial image in the sequence is represented by a pyramid whose levels are divided into non-overlapping blocks of the same size, and hybrid image descriptor are employed to extract features in all blocks. Then the obtained descriptor is filtered out using feature selection. Finally, non-linear SVM is applied to predict the drowsiness state of the subject in the image. The proposed method was tested on the public dataset NTH Drowsy Driver Detection (NTHUDDD). This dataset includes a wide range of human subjects of different genders, poses, and illuminations in real-life fatigue conditions. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. These results show that the proposed hand-crafted feature compare favorably with several approaches based on the use of deep Convolutional Neural Nets.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['facial images']}",9,7

A Multi Level System Design for Vigilance Measurement based on Head Posture Estimation and Eyes Blinking,"Driving security is an important task for human society. The major challenge in the field of accident avoidance systems is the driver vigilance monitoring. The lack of vigilance can be noticed by various ways, such as, fatigue, drowsiness and distraction. Hence, the need of a reliable driver's vigilance decrease detection system which can alert drivers before a mishap happens. In this paper, we present a novel approach for vigilance estimation based on multilevel system by combining head movement analysis and eyes blinking. We have used Viola and Jones algorithm to analyse head movement and a classification system using wavelet networks for eyelid closure measuring. The contribution of our application is classifiying the vigilance state at multi level. This is different from the binary-class (awakening or hypovigilant state) existing in most popular systems","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['head movement', 'eye blinking']}",6,5
Neuro-network approach to the classification of psychological states of a control operator of a potentially dangerous object,"The study is devoted to the problem of ensuring the trouble-free functioning of potentially dangerous objects (PDO) by increasing the reliability of the human factor (HF). It is shown that this problem belongs to the category of priority and critical areas of scientific and technological development of the Russian Federation. It is emphasized that the task of effective management of the HF is complex, due to the specifics of the object of study - the operator of PDO management, which can be fully attributed to the category of complex systems. The relevance of using an adequate methodological apparatus for the analysis and reliable prediction of a possible change in the functional and psycho-emotional state (FPS) of the operator is substantiated. The advantages and disadvantages of the classical systemic and functional approaches are considered. The main advantages and prospects of using a neural network approach to solving the problems of monitoring FPS and predicting its possible change are analyzed.Areas of the most appropriate use of artificial neural networks have been identified. These include: processing the source audio and video data of the visible and infrared optical spectra; complex processing of a set of dynamic bio-parameters recorded by various remote non-contact technologies; classification of the current FPC and the forecast of its possible change taking into account the effect of fatigue accumulation. The heterogeneity of the recorded bio-parameters and other external factors that determine the current FPS of the operators is highlighted as one of the important problems that limit the ability to implement the neural network approach in practice.It is shown that the use of the uniform format for the representation of heterogeneous data considered in the work makes it possible to take into account bio-parameters that objectively characterize the state of the basic systems of the body, as well as parameters responsible for the conditions of professional activity and the psychological climate in the team. The main advantages of using this form of presentation are: increasing the reliability of estimates and forecasts of possible changes in the FPS of operators and the possibility of using the developed neural network methodological and technical tools. It is concluded that the neural network approach is promising for the creation of intelligent monitoring and forecasting systems for possible changes in the FPS of PDO control operators in order to ensure their reliable trouble-free operation.","{'operator type': ['operator'], 'data acquisition methods': ['audio', 'video', 'bio-parameters']}",7,6
Research on Railway Dispatcher Fatigue Detection Method Based on Deep Learning with Multi-Feature Fusion,"Traffic command and scheduling are the core monitoring aspects of railway transportation. Detecting the fatigued state of dispatchers is, therefore, of great significance to ensure the safety of railway operations. In this paper, we present a multi-feature fatigue detection method based on key points of the human face and body posture. Considering unfavorable factors such as facial occlusion and angle changes that have limited single-feature fatigue state detection methods, we developed our model based on the fusion of body postures and facial features for better accuracy. Using facial key points and eye features, we calculate the percentage of eye closure that accounts for more than 80% of the time duration, as well as blinking and yawning frequency, and we analyze fatigue behaviors, such as yawning, a bowed head (that could indicate sleep state), and lying down on a table, using a behavior recognition algorithm. We fuse five facial features and behavioral postures to comprehensively determine the fatigue state of dispatchers. The results show that on the 300 W dataset, as well as a hand-crafted dataset, the inference time of the improved facial key point detection algorithm based on the retina-face model was 100 ms and that the normalized average error (NME) was 3.58. On our own dataset, the classification accuracy based the an Bi-LSTM-SVM adaptive enhancement algorithm model reached 97%. Video data of volunteers who carried out scheduling operations in the simulation laboratory were used for our experiments, and our multi-feature fusion fatigue detection algorithm showed an accuracy rate of 96.30% and a recall rate of 96.30% in fatigue classification, both of which were higher than those of existing single-feature detection methods. Our multi-feature fatigue detection method offers a potential solution for fatigue level classification in vital areas of the industry, such as in railway transportation.","{'operator type': ['dispatcher'], 'data acquisition methods': ['facial key points', 'body posture', 'eye features', 'blinking', 'yawning', 'eye closure percentage', 'behavioral analysis']}",9,9
Driving Fatigue Effects on Cross-Frequency Phase Synchrony Embedding in Multilayer Brain Network,"Driver fatigue has been intensively investigated for recent decades; nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. This study explored the cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between slow and fast oscillations in a multilayer brain network description of the functional brain network. Specifically, we compared the topological characteristics of the CFC-embedded multilayer brain networks in the vigilant and fatigue states. From the 24-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded on 20 subjects, we found that the CFC of the fatigue state was elevated, especially in the beta-gamma coupling and in the frontal pole, frontal, and parietal regions. Results also revealed profound differences in the topology of the multilayer brain network between the vigilant and fatigue states, particularly the significant increases in the global and local efficiencies of the multilayer network in the fatigue state that were closely related to the behavioral performance, i.e., the reaction time. What is more, a graph neural network (GNN) was developed for imitating the features of the within-frequency subnetworks diffused through the CFC to detect fatigue with a satisfactory classification accuracy (96.23%). The proposed approach could enhance our understanding about neural coordination across frequencies in driver fatigue and would facilitate fatigue-related studies for a better understanding about the underlying mechanism and ultimately a traffic accident reduction.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eeg']}",10,10
On the design of a human-robot interaction strategy for commercial vehicle driving based on human cognitive parameters,"A proper design of human-robot interaction strategies based on human cognitive factors can help to compensate human limitations for safety purposes. This work is focused on the development of a human-robot interaction system for commercial vehicle (Renault Twizy) driving, that uses driver cognitive parameters to improve driver's safety during day and night tasks. To achieve this, eye blink behavior measurements are detected using a convolutional neural network, which is capable of operating under variable illumination conditions using an infrared camera. Percentage of eye closure measure values along with blink frequency are used to infer diver's sleepiness level. The use of such algorithm is validated with experimental tests for subjects under different sleep-quality conditions. Additional cognitive parameters are also analyzed for the human-robot interaction system such as driver sleep quality, distraction level, stress level, and the effects related to not wearing glasses. Based on such driver cognitive state parameters, a human-robot interaction strategy is proposed to limit the speed of a Renault Twizy vehicle by intervening its acceleration and braking system. The proposed human-robot interaction strategy can increase safety during driving tasks for both users and pedestrians.","{'operator type': ['driver'], 'data acquisition methods': ['eye tracking']}",8,6
Physiological parameters variation during driving simulations,"This paper deals with the methodology of using biorobotics principles for creating a new intelligent system, to improve safety in an automobile transportation. Many projects in European Union programs are devoted to the increase of safety in automotive, in order to reduce deaths and accidents down to 50% in the next few years.

Driver's Fatigue Prediction by Deep Covariance Learning from EEG,"We present here deep covariance learning models for predicting drivers' drowsy and alert states from Electroencephalography (EEG). Three types of deep covariance learning models are proposed: SPDNet, CNN, and DNN on covariance matrices. Our test results show that all the deep covariance learning methods reported better performance than shallow learning methods including Riemannian methods and STCNN, a previously proposed CNN model for EEG classification. Among the deep covariance learning methods, the best classification performance is obtained by a CNN model applied on sample spatial EEG covariance matrices and it improved the AUC of the best shallow algorithm (logistic regression + Log-Euclidean Metric) by 12.32% from 70.96% to 86.14%.

Real Time Driver Alertness System Based on Eye Aspect Ratio and Head Pose Estimation,"Drowsy driving is one of the main causes of traffic accidents that leads to the loss of men and material. There are two methods to detect the alertness of the driver: first method focuses on the driver's performance and second method focuses on the driver's state. Furthermore, methods focusing on driver's state are of two types groups: methods using brain signals and methods using image processing. This paper presents a real-time image processing system to detect the alertness of a driver based on the estimation of eye-aspect ratio (EAR) and the head-pose (HP) estimation. A camera is used to obtain the data of the driver and computer vision based methods are used to detect driver's state. The video segments captured by the camera are analyzed using image processing techniques. The EAR and the HP are continuously estimated to detect the alertness of a vehicle driver.
