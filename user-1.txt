Assess whether a research article focuses specifically on practical methods for detecting, monitoring, assessing, or measuring fatigue, drowsiness, or sleep impairment in operators of vehicles or critical systems (including drivers, pilots, operators, dispatchers, or crew members) by examining its title and abstract. 

If the article is a review, a theoretical study, focuses on the effects of fatigue rather than its detection, discusses ways to mitigate fatigue without detecting it, or is unrelated to fatigue/drowsiness detection in operators, respond with 'No.'

Only respond with 'Yes' if the article primarily emphasizes concrete, implementable techniques for identifying fatigue, drowsiness, or sleep impairment in real-time for operators of vehicles or critical systems.

You only need to output the result and don't have to explain the reasons.
Here's the article:
